> I request Excel Rehab & Sports to perform a complimentary screening. I understand the purpose of this screening is to assess my symptoms and suggest a plan of action; it is not a medical examination or diagnosis, nor is it a substitute for a complete physical therapy evaluation. I understand a licensed Physical Therapist will perform the screening, not a Medical Physician. I acknowledge and agree I am responsible for arranging and for obtaining any follow up medical care, with a medical provider of my choice. I am under no obligation to select Excel Rehab & Sports for any follow up services, and this screening is not conditioned on my use of any goods or services from Excel Rehab & Sports. I have not been offered any special discounts on follow-up services.
