> **Question:** Where do I send medical records requests?

> **Answer:** Requests for records from Agile should be emailed to [medrecs@allianceptp.com](mailto:medrecs@allianceptp.com)

> **Question:** What about medical records requests for records in a system other than Agile?
> 
> **Answer:** Requests for records in an EMR other than Agile will continue to be processed locally by the front office staff.

> **Question:** Who are the individuals processing the records and how do I contact them?
> 
> **Answer:** Gwyn Gissing and Orianna Jensen are processing medical records. Both team members can be reached at the [medrecs@allianceptp.com](mailto:medrecs@allianceptp.com) email address.
