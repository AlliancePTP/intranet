⭐ The purpose of this protocol is to outline a process for Work Conditioning/SMART from the point of intake to scheduling.

</aside>

**Specific Measurable Activity for Return to work Tasks(SMART)** is a structured physical conditioning program focusing on cardiovascular fitness, strength, flexibility and endurance, as well as work simulated activities to promote safe return to work.

Our program is typically 3-5 hours per day, 3-5 days/week for approximately a 4-week time frame unless otherwise specified by the Attending Physician. This program is tailored to the needs of the patient and the job demands to which they will return. **2 hrs/day and 3 days/wk is minimal frequency.**

### Three main avenues for a work conditioning referral to occur:

- Internal Referral: A therapist will recommend the SMART program for a current patient in the Progress Note
- External Referral: An insurance or attending physician may send referral for current patient or new patient
- FCE test Recommendation: A therapist may suggest the SMART program beneficial for Return to Work

At times, you may receive a phone call for Work Conditioning/SMART

- Inform the caller that your clinics do offer a Work Conditioning program
- Instruct the caller to fax a referral with Work Conditioning as the treatment (ask for 5 days per week for optimal results)

1. **Ensure the referral states Work Conditioning is treatment and no less than 3x/wk**
-*if referral has incorrect frequency or work hardening as tx., need to call and have new referral sent over*

 Create a **new Agile case** for patient *(even if it is a current PT patient, a new case MUST be created*)

 Inform your Work Comp Lead (or CD) the above is complete timely

 **DO NOT SCHEDULE THE PATIENT at this time**

1. **Email Lindsey Nicholson ccing your Work Comp Lead** (WCL)/CD that you received a Work Cond referral. **Flag the email as high importance and title email “Work Conditioning referral needs scheduling”.** Please include the following Info:

 Patient name and Case #

 Lindsey will inform you to gather written authorization for treatment from Work Comp (or Auto) Adjuster or Third Party Admin (Medrisk, One Call, etc.)

1. **Scheduling -** Lindsey and your Work Comp Lead or CD will coordinate with next steps

 Written authorization is obtained & scanned into case files

 Coordinate scheduling 1st visit with your Work Comp Lead (ensure 1:1 time 1st visit for 1 hr, patient should be prepared for a full length visit day 1 (ie, if 5 hours is duration, patient will be there 5 hours day 1, if patient cannot stay for total length, appointment will have to be rescheduled)

 **Visit type = Work Conditioning** on scheduler for ALL appts.
