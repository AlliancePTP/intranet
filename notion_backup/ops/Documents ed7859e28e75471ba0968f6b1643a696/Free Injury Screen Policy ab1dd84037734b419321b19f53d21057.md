# Complimentary Physical Therapy Screening Policy & Process

**Policy** – Instruction for how to process a Complimentary Physical Therapy Screening

**Purpose -** The primary purpose of the complimentary Physical Therapy Screening is to help educate the client on whether there is a potential need for clinical evaluation by a relevant healthcare provider.

# Overview

When a client signs up for a complimentary screening – they may do so in three ways:

- Direct call to your clinic
- Form fill on your website
- Form fill from a Strive-driven email (An alert will be sent to your designated Strive contact)

There should be at least 3 attempts to contact each complimentary screening lead (twice by phone, once via email) in the first 5 days after signup. Please oversee the process and track conversion percentage.

it is imperative that you contact the client and discuss their options - the client can opt for a complimentary screening or a new initial evaluation. Clients should be made aware that a complimentary screening is a 15-minute visit with a physical therapist, with no associated cost.

The goal of these visits is for the physical therapist to provide a quick assessment, some advice, perhaps review a past home exercise program, or identify if the client would benefit from a formal course of physical therapy.

From a compliance perspective, at the time of the complimentary screening we cannot develop a new / revise an existing HEP program as this is usually a billable service.

It is important to obtain all secondary referral sources (Marketing information) on the Complimentary Screening Intake Form for tracking purposes.

If the client believes they will likely need a formal course of physical therapy, they can also opt to schedule a 60-minute initial evaluation, but this is not complimentary and will be billed through their insurance. Each client should be educated on their choices, and then scheduled per their request.

# Clinic Work Flow

When a client calls the clinic requesting a complimentary physical therapy screen the Front Office Coordinator will schedule a 15 minutes block with a licensed Physical Therapist.

The Front Office Coordinator will enter into the schedule a Clinician Appointment Block called “Screen” and manually write the client’s Name and Body Region being addressed.

The paper document titled “Complimentary Screening Intake Form” will be used to document the screen.

Only after the client has completed and signed the Complimentary Screening Intake Form can they be screened by the Physical Therapist.

The complimentary screen should not last any longer than 15 minutes.

The complimentary screen should be scheduled within 24 hours of the request being made unless otherwise requested by the client.

There will be no ‘standing blocks’ of time on the schedule dedicated to performing complimentary screens. The complimentary screen should be scheduled in a manner that is both convenient to the client and the licensed therapist.

The scheduling of complimentary screens should not interfere with the continuity of clinical care of our active patients.

Although the assessment may require manual contact with the client, it should be kept to a minimum.

Based on State and Regulatory guidelines, no diagnosis is to be provided or treatment delivered at this visit.

Licensed clinician will complete the “Physical therapy screening Report” and explain to the client the anticipated benefits of physical therapy if the findings warrant.

If the client agrees with recommendations to initiate physical therapy treatment, the Front Office Coordinator will fax the completed “Physical therapy screening Report” to the potential referring physician. Alternatively, if the client wishes to manage the communication with their physician, provide them a copy of the Physical therapy screening Report instead.

The paper copy of the completed Complimentary Screening Intake Form and Physical therapy screening Report should be stapled together and kept in a locked cabinet for a period of 12 months before being shredded.

Within one week of performing the complimentary screen the clinician should follow up with the client if no communication has been received.
