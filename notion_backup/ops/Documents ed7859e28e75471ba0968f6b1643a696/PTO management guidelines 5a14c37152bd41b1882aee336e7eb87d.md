**PTO – Guidelines for Effective Planning**

As a Clinic Director or clinician, it is important to understand and manage PTO effectively. Managing PTO ensures employees have sufficient rest to maintain good health. For our patients, it ensures we are able to meet their plan of care and maintain clinical quality.

**Guidelines for PTO Requests**

- First come first serve (except holiday weeks that will be distributed evenly by the clinic leadership)
- Be familiar with your clinic’s limits for maximum time off per week before submitting request (see guidelines below)
- Employees are encouraged to disperse their PTO across the entire calendar year
- Employees who accrue up to 15 days off per year should have at least one week used or two weeks scheduled by **May 1st**
- Employees should communicate a detailed plan for the rest of the calendar year by **April 1st**
- No more than 25% of your annual PTO allowance should be used in the 4th quarter unless there are exceptional circumstances
- All PTO requests that fall on a holiday week (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, etc.) should be submitted in writing and prioritized (e.g. 1st choice, 2nd choice, etc.) by **June 1st**
- All remaining PTO requests for the calendar year should be submitted by **September 1st**
- All PTO requests should be submitted at least 45 days in advance
- An employee cannot have a negative PTO balance

**Continuity of care**

- If you will be away for a week, you should schedule out your patients past your PTO
- Reprint the schedule for each patient so they are aware of who will be treating them
- If practical, introduce each patient to the treating therapist who is covering for you
- Prepare important treatment information about each patient to help the treating therapist
- Explain how you want the patient to progress and give a progress update
- Try to avoid leaving a progress note / new plan of care for the treating therapist unless it’s unavoidable.
- Provide information if there are any changes or new exercises to be added

**Guidance for Clinic Directors**

- Stick to 45-day lead time for planning
- Be fair. Deny requests only when necessary, but work with your team to find days that will work for them
- Get a 12-month dry erase calendar to keep in your office so you have visibility of approved PTO requests
- Know clinic’s limits for maximum time allowed off per non-holiday week and deny requests that exceed that:
    - > 60 V/Day Clinics: no more than 60 hours in a week
    - 31- 59 V/Day Clinics: no more than 40 hours in a week
    - 0 - 30 V/Day Clinics (With Coverage): no more than 40 hours in a week
    - 0 - 30 V/Day Clinics (Without Coverage): no more than 20 hours in a week without coverage being secured prior
- If you want to approve PTO that exceeds the guidelines, collaborate with your Group Director regarding outside coverage
- Don’t approve requests and expect that outside coverage will happen. Find coverage first and then approve.
- Only pursue outside coverage when the clinic is operating at greater than 75% capacity. Be self-sufficient when at a low patient census
