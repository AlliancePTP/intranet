# Be Prepared

- Greet the patient warmly, by name
- State to the patient "My name is (Mark), and I am your Physical Therapist"
- Know the Dx & Co-Morbidities prior to the Initial Evaluation
- Read all pertinent information prior to greeting the patient (MD notes, Special imaging & examinations...)
- Be on time. [Early is on-time; On-time is late; Late is inexcusable!]
- When asking a question, eye contact with the patient ..not on the computer! Be Present!

# Dress

- Wearing appropriate attire
- Clothing neat, clean, and shirt tucked in if appropriate
- Display your name badge (name and who you are)

# Attitude

- A Professional Attitude is *not* arrogant or distant
- Confident (even if you are not in this case...fake it until you become confident)
- Warm & Engaging
- Good positive energy
- Good at "active listening"
- Project Leadership in your interactions
    - You are the Leader, the PT in charge ...not the patient!
    - A Physician does not say, "Mr. Smith, how often do you want to take your medicine"? Set the expectation you believe will move the patient to their goals (if 3 times a week is necessary ...say "I need you here 3/week")
- Be very specific in what you need the patient to do (many patients will dictate the meeting if you let them)
- Your confidence and expertise need to create value to the patient. Be in the driver's seat. Do not let the patient determine when and how often they need to see you.

# Schedule & Caseloads

- Utilize the various reports and tools to let you "see" and "understand ' your patient population
- Use the cancellation / NS report and Case Appointment Inactivity Report to prevent your patients from slipping through the cracks .

# Ownershi p

- This means to fully commit to this patient, "jump in with both feet", and be earnest
- Each session, with every patient. .. offer your complete focus of attention. Do not "go through the motions"
- If you are perplexed, seek advice and inter-consult
- Make every visit count. The patient must understand how the activities of every session move them to their goals.
- Any patient can tell when you are truly working their problem and giving them all you have. That is all a patient is asking. That is "Patient Satisfaction". They know you did everything you could.
- My primary thought is "How can I get this patient to change"?
- Don't assume that the patient knows their treatment plan. Make the effort to reinforce it each session and ask them questions for clarification.

# Self-Reflection

- Take time through the week to reflect on what went well or poorly; why did this patient flare, and this patient didn't; why isn't this patient progressing?
- Could you have prepared more for a particular patient?
