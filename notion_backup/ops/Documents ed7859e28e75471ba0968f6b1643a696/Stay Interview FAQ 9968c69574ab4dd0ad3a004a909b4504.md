Stay Interview FAQ

---

In the next few weeks, you will be contacted by your Clinical Director, Group Leader, or (ETC) about scheduling a Stay Interview.

What is a Stay Interview?

- A Stay Interview is a structured discussion a manager conducts with an employee to learn specific actions the leader can take to strengthen the employee’s engagement and retention with the organization. This is not a performance or disciplinary review.

What do I say?

This is a time to be honest in order to build trust between managers and their team members. No need to prepare anything in advance.
