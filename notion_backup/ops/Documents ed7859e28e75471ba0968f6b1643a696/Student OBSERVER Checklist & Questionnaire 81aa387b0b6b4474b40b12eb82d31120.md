**Student Shadowing / Observer Checklist**

Since the primary purpose of shadowing is ***observation***, the experience should focus on watching the physical therapist / physical therapy assistant as s/he performs his or her duties. The pre-physical therapy / physical therapy assistant student should never engage in any activity that is considered the practice of physical therapy. These activities include, but are not limited to: diagnosing impairments, performing therapeutic procedures and modalities, providing medical advice or other tasks generally reserved for the trained physical therapy professional.

Supervising clinicians are required to complete this checklist and questionnaire for all student observers ***prior to*** the first day of student observation. The completed checklist and forms should be emailed to the Privacy Officer at [privacyofficer@allianceptp.com](mailto:privacyofficer@allianceptp.com) .

The supervising clinician should provide the following documents to each student observer:

□ Student Observer Questionnaire (see Student Questionnaire section below)

□ HIPAA Course Material for review

□ Student HIPAA Attestation form – student signature required

□ Student Observer Agreement – signature required

□ Student Confidentiality Agreement – signature required

□ Student Waiver of Liability Form – signature required

Student Questionnaire

This information allows us to complete the required background and exclusions checks.
