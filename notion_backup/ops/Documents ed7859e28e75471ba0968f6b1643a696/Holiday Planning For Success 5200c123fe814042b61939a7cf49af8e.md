**Holidays – Planning for success**

Careful preparation before, during and after holidays will ensure that we maintain the same quality of service that our patients receive in normal weeks. The care that we provide to our patients should not be compromised because it is a holiday week. Embracing the tactics outlined below will minimize disruption to our patients and clinical operations.

| Quarter 1 | • Plan your staffing needs for each of the six holidays and ensure you that have the coverage to maintain patient plan of care.
• All holiday PTO requests should be submitted in writing and prioritized (e.g. 1st choice, 2nd choice, etc.) by March 31st.
• Discuss with your clinic staff general expectations regarding holiday week management and expectation regarding coverage and flexing schedules
• Remove all non-clinical time on the holiday weeks to maximize appointment availability |
| --- | --- |
| Count down tasks to complete before each holiday |  |
| H minus 6 wks | • Communicate to your entire clinic team about upcoming holiday and general expectations. Have clinic staff speak to patients about importance of adhering to their plan of care and schedule past the holiday week. |
| H minus 4 wks | • Block off two evaluation spots each day on each PT schedule for the holiday week. This will prevent having to schedule too many evaluations into the following week. |
| H minus 3 wks | • Review your holiday week staffing and schedules. Flex days, hours and staffing to ensure appropriate coverage.
• Remind your patients of the upcoming holiday week and any adjustments to their appointments.
• Review all patients with the primary clinicians to prevent premature discharging of patients.
• Make sure patients are scheduled for their normal frequency.
• Don’t be afraid to schedule ‘back to back’ appointments. Change up the content of the treatment sessions.
• Look at the schedule to identify those patients you can easily overlap.
• Plan how you are going to re-capture any cancellations from Tues-Thurs or accommodate new evaluations. |
| H minus 2 wks
&
H minus 1 wk | • Make sure patients have a copy of their schedules.
• Identify new patient slots in the holiday week.
• Schedule patients past the holiday week as necessary.
• Understand which patients and what times we can overlap.
• Start planning fun activities for each of the days during the holiday week. |
| Week
Of Holiday | • Work as one team to manage scheduled patients.
• Support your clinic staff to make sure things are running smoothly and address any issues.
• Schedule new evaluations in a timely manner and reschedule cancellations/no shows throughout the week. |
| Week After Holiday | • Back to normal as soon as possible.
• Scrub schedule to make sure no patient has fallen off.
• Monday - contact any active patients who have no appointments scheduled.
• Convert referrals into evaluations, as quickly as possible, to rebuild the clinic’s patient population and avoid a post-holiday hangover. |
