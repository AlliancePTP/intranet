The *Be Great Today!* PTA Mentoring Program is an 8- week program designed to accelerate the professional development of recently graduated physical therapist assistants so they can provide a “best-in class” experience for their patients and build a foundation of success with the Alliance Physical Therapy Partners family.
> 
> New graduates are excited to reach the final step in their journey to becoming a physical therapist assistant. However, there is still a big learning curve once they graduate and become licensed. That learning curve not only entails the rest of their clinical experience, but also the responsibility and accountability of caring for patients, learning how to accommodate productivity goals, maintaining communication with physicians and other providers, supervising and directing staff, and maintaining a healthy work–life balance. They need to put in the time to get their clinical skills down pat, build on documentation efficiency and patient rapport, then add the productivity and administrative aspects. How can we help?
> 
> Research highlights that mentorship is a key component of professional development in any career. When a new graduate gains mentorship vs trial and error, they are practicing under a watchful and experienced eye and form a network of peers and colleagues to ease the transition from student to clinician.
> 
> The *Be Great Today!* Mentorship Program will provide these new graduates with a foundation to build their practice and the support to ensure they succeed. Our goal is to elevate the quality of care for our patients and fast-track the new graduates’ ability for total patient management. This extensive program focuses on advancing skills and knowledge including educational techniques, research methodology, clinical skills, and administrative practices.

The objective is to tailor an individualized continuing education course plan that meets the needs of both the participant and their respective clinic. As a new graduate, it can be incredibly valuable to have focused education and learning experiences that will help move them from entry-level to expert.

# The Mentor Role

- The mentor prepares the mentee to use evidence and multiple sources of information to make decisions about patient care and practice.
- The mentor uses coaching strategies for corrective action, insight, and self-discovery of the mentee.
- The mentor prepares the mentee to address and manage the patient and make clinical judgments in the often-changing environment of practice and health care.

- Be a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant who can manage multiple sources of information: patient needs, ability to identify clinical learning deficits of the mentee, and development of the mentor/mentee working relationship. All of these components must be directed toward managing the patient and delivering excellent service.
