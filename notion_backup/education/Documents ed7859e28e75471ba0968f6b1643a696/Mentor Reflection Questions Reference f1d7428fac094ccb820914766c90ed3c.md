# Initial Data Gathering/Interview REFLECTION POINTS:

- How does the patient’s medical diagnosis affect your interview?
- How might your personal biases/assumptions affect your interview?
- Assessing the information you gathered, what do you see as a pattern or connection between the symptoms?
- What is the value of the data you gathered?
- What are some of the judgments you can draw from the data?
- What is your assessment of the patient’s/caregiver’s knowledge and understanding of their diagnosis and need for PT?
- Have you verified the patient’s goals?
- Based on the information gathered, are you able to assess a need for a referral to another health care professional?

# Generation of Initial Hypothesis

1. Body structures/functions
2. Impairments
3. Activity limitations
4. Participation restrictions

# REFLECTION POINTS:

- Can you construct a hypothesis based on the information gathered?
- What is that based on (biases, experiences)?
- How did you arrive at the hypothesis? How can you explain your rationale?
- What about this patient and the information you have gathered might support your hypothesis?
- What do you anticipate could be an outcome for this patient (prognosis)?
- Based on your hypothesis, how might your strategy for the examination be influenced?
- What is your approach/planned sequence/strategy for the examination?
- How might other diagnostic information affect your examination?

# Examination RELECTION POINTS:

- Appraising the tests and measures you selected for your examination, how and why did you select them?
- Reflecting on these tests, how might they support/negate your hypothesis?
- Can the identified tests and measures help you determine a change in status?
- How did you organize the examination? What might you do differently?
- Discuss other systems not tested that may be affecting the patient’s problem.
- Compare your examination findings for this patient with another patient with a similar medical diagnosis.
- How does your selection of tests and measures relate to the patient’s goals?

# Evaluation REFLECTION POINTS:

- How did you determine your diagnosis? What about this patient suggested your diagnosis?
- How did your examination findings support or negate your initial hypothesis?
- What is your appraisal of the most important issues to work on? How do these relate to the patient’s goals and identified issues?
- What factors might support or interfere with the patient’s prognosis?
- How might other factors such as bodily functions and environmental and societal factors affect the patient?
- What is your rationale for the prognosis, and what are the positive and negative prognostic indicators?
- How will you go about developing a therapeutic relationship?
- How might any cultural factors influence your care of the patient?
- What are your considerations for behavior, motivation, and readiness?
- How can you determine capacity for progress toward goals?

# Plan of Care REFLECTION POINTS:

- How have you incorporated the patient’s goals?
- How do the goals reflect your examination and evaluation?
- How did you determine the PT prescription or plan of care (frequency, intensity, anticipated length of service)?
- How do key elements of the PT plan of care relate back to primary diagnosis?
- How do the patient’s personal and environmental factors affect the PT plan of care?

# Interventions REFLECTION POINTS:

- Discuss your overall PT approach or strategies (eg, motor learning, strengthening).
- Are there specific aspects about this patient to keep in mind?
- How does your approach relate to theory and current evidence?
- As you designed your intervention plan, how did you select specific strategies?
- What is your rationale for those intervention strategies?
- How do the interventions relate to the primary problem areas?
- How might you need to modify your interventions for this patient?
- What are the communication needs with other team members?
- What are the documentation aspects?
- How will you ensure safety?
- Patient education:
    - What are your overall strategies for teaching?
    - Describe learning styles/barriers and any possible accommodations for the patient.
    - How can you ensure understanding and buy-in?
    - What communication strategies (verbal and nonverbal) will be most successful?

# Ongoing Reexamination REFLECTION POINTS:

- Evaluate the effectiveness of your interventions. Do you need to modify anything?
- What have you learned about the patient/caregiver that you did not know before?
- How does this patient’s progress toward goals compare with that of other patients with a similar diagnosis?
- Is there anything that you overlooked, misinterpreted, overvalued, or undervalued, and what might you do differently? Will this address any potential errors you have made?
- How has your interaction with the patient changed?
- How might any new factors affect the patient outcome?
- How do the characteristics of the patient’s progress affect your goals, prognosis, and anticipated outcome?
- How can you determine the patient’s views (satisfaction/frustration) about his or her progress toward goals? How might that affect your plan of care?
- How has PT affected the patient’s life?

# Outcomes REFLECTION POINTS:

- Was PT effective, and what outcome measures did you use to assess the outcome?
- Why or why not?
    - What criteria did you or will you use to determine whether the patient has met his or her goals?
    - How do you determine the patient is ready to return to home/community/work/school/sports?
    - What barriers (physical, personal, environmental), if any, are there to discharge?
    - What are the anticipated life-span needs, and what are they based on?
    - How can you and the patient/caregiver partner together for a lifetime plan for wellness?
