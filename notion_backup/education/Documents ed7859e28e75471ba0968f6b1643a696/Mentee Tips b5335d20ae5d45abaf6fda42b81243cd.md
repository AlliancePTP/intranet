# Mentorship Program Participant Tips

> YOUR MENTORSHIP EXPERIENCE DEPENDS ON YOU!
> 
> 
> If you are serious about learning from your mentor, set out clear goals for your time together, but be open to new ideas. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your mentor/mentee relationship:
> 

# Be prepared for your mentoring sessions.

> The more effort you put into the relationship, the more you'll get out of it. Dedicate time to organizing yourself before talking to your mentor so you both will get more out of the session.
> 

# Work with your mentor to establish a mutually agreeable plan for mentoring sessions.

> When you work with your mentor to set up the ground rules, you have a better chance of developing a respectful, enriching relationship.
> 

# Ask direct questions about what you most want to know.

> Just like in any relationship, professional or personal, open communication is key to a great relationship. Speak up to ask questions, even if you feel they might be too basic or that your mentor will probably get to it later.
> 

# Provide context and brief updates to help your mentor understand you.

> A mentor/mentee relationship is a 2-way street. Your mentor needs to understand your working environment, specialty areas, and patient demographics to be better able to help you advance your career.
> 

# Earn your mentor's respect.

> By being prepared for sessions, respecting your mentor's boundaries, and following up on your agreements, you are going to communicate to your mentor that you are worth the time and effort he or she has committed to your relationship. If you lose your mentor's respect by not living up to your end of the bargain, you are likely to see the relationship falter.
> 

# Show your appreciation.

> Show your appreciation for a mentor's time and energy. The most obvious way is to simply say, "Thank you." Always thank your mentor for his or her time after a session. The occasional appreciative email can also goes a long way.
