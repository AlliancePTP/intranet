> At the request of our Legal Department, we would like to take this opportunity to address Alliance’s stance on safeguarding employee information. This obligation is different from the ones we have under HIPAA; however, it is just as important for several reasons.
> 
- Employers have an obligation to protect employees’ confidential information. Failure to do so could result in legal liability and poor reputation for Alliance, its affiliates and partners.
- If a third party is inquiring about employees you supervise, please direct such third party to the Legal Department and the HR Department.
- Exceptions to the disclosure of employee information include: (1) requests from a government agency; or (2) requests from counsel, pursuant to a valid subpoena.
- Each request, including exceptions, must be reviewed by the Legal Department and the HR Department before any disclosure can be made.

> Thank you for your cooperation and ensuring we continue to protect our company and our co-workers. If you have any questions regarding this information, please contact the Compliance Officer at compliance@allianceptp.com or the IT Security team at itsec@allianceptp.com .
