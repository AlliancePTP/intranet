> Enclosed you will find Alliance’s ‘Red Envelope Policy’. The purpose of this policy is to enable our employees to quickly and compliantly cooperate with authorities should they arrive onsite and provide notice of any lawful inspection, audit, inquiry or investigation including execution of valid warrants and subpoenas.
> 
> Inside the Red Envelope, you will find the following:
> 
1. ‘Dear Investigator’ letter - in the event of an onsite visit, this letter should be provided to authorities. Please note that this letter will need to be dated by staff.
2. Policy / Instruction sheet detailing the steps staff members should take in the event authorities arrive onsite.
3. Investigation Checklist – this is to be completed by an onsite staff member. Please make sure to answer all questions on the investigation checklist.

> The Red Envelope should be placed in a conspicuous place in the front office of the clinic to allow access by all staff members. Please review the information inside the Red Envelope with your staff members. In the event of an onsite visit by authorities, it is important that everyone know where Red Envelope is located so they may respond appropriately.
