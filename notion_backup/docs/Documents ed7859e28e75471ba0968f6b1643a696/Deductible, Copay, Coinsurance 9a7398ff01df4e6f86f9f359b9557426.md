> ***For example:*** Your plan has a $500 deductible. You pay the full charges for covered services up to $500. After you reach this amount you pay just a copay or coinsurance for each visit.
> 
> **Copay:** The set amount you pay for covered services.
> 
> *For example:* A doctor visit costs $120. You pay a $20 copay when you visit the doctor. Kaiser Permanente covers the rest ($100).
