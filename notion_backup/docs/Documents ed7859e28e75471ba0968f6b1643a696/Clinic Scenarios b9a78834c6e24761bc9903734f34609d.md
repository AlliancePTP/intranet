**Scenario 1**

**P&L statement (see below)**

Your clinic is struggling with regard to overall profitability. The net income (profit) percentage is significantly less than the industry norm of approximately 25%. The clinic has a similar amount of total visits per month as another clinic that is only three miles away but a significantly lower profit margin.

What reasons do you think could be causing the relatively low profit margin in your clinic?

What actions will you need to take to improve the profitability of your clinic?

| Clinic A | Period Actual | % of Revenue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total Revenue: | $442,621.48 | 100.00% |
| Total Salaries & Benefits: | $304,913.58 | 68.89% |

**Scenario 2**

**Cancelation and No-Show Rate**

You have just been appointed the Clinic Director of an existing clinic that has been underperforming for a considerable period. As a new leader you appreciate and understand that you need to focus on one issue at a time. You have decided to direct your attention to addressing the historically high cancelation and no-show rate. The national average for Cx/NS rate for Out Patient Physical Therapy clinics is approximately 10%, this is compared to your clinic that has averaged 24.9% for the last 15 weeks.

1. What do you think could be the reasons for the high Cx/NS rate
2. What tactics do you plan to implement to address the high Cx/NS rate?

**Scenario 3**

**Under Performing Clinician**

Situation:

You hired a new grad PTA, Becky, just under three months ago. Things went well for a couple of weeks and then you started noticing some issues. Becky started to regularly miss work or arrive and then leave early due to not feeling well or personal issues. Becky would leave even though there were non-clinical tasks, including cleaning, phone calls, etc that needed to be done. On multiple occasions Becky stated, “I don’t know how I’ll be today” or “I just don’t know if I can do it today” to various staff members regarding illness or tone when working with patients. Even Becky’s conversations with patients seemed to be focused on why she wasn’t at work the day/s before.

When you provided clinical care to Becky’s patients when she was off, multiple patients stated they had never been told certain things regarding HEP or the correct way to perform exercises. When cued on this they stated, “no one told me that before” or “no one explained that to me”. You also noticed that Becky added Ultrasound for a few patients without consulting with a supervising physical therapist before altering the treatment plan.

After 45 days of employment you had accumulated sufficient performance and attendance issues to schedule a ‘performance check-in’ (including 7 documented days of unscheduled absence or leaving work early). However, on the day of the scheduled ‘performance check-in’ Becky called out. The meeting was rescheduled, and again Becky called out. When you did meet with Becky she arrived with a note from a LMSW with autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. In addition, Becky verbally states that they are recommending she reduce her schedule to part-time working 2-3 days/week to allow her to destress and work on her art which is calming to her. The note from the LMSW stated “is often exhausted and overwhelmed from full work days. She is constantly worrying about how to fit in w/her sensory struggles and difficulty with social interactions. This tension causes much physical and mental stress, contributing to daily migraines”.

1. Can you terminate Becky’s employment?
2. What should you have done prior to the 45 day ‘performance check-in’
3. If determined appropriate, what should have been discussed and action plan included in the 45 day ‘performance check-in’

**Scenario 4**

**Units Per Visit (benchmark 4.0 timed units per visit)**

You have just been appointed the Clinic Director of an existing clinic that is not charging / meeting the average duration of treatment session required to achieve higher than average clinical outcomes. (measured by skilled units per visit).

To optimize the clinical outcomes you need to increase their skilled units per visit from approximately 3.6 to 4.0.

1. What could be the various reasons why the existing average skilled units per visit are approximately 3.6?
2. What strategy and tactics should you implement to raise the average skilled units per visit to 4.0?

**Scenario 5**

**Managing an unexpected absence**

On your way to work early Monday morning you receive a text from Richard, one of your physical therapists, saying that he is ill and will not be coming in. You checked the clinicians’ schedules on Sunday and know the schedules are relatively busy for that day.

As the Clinic Director, what strategies and tactics can you employ to minimize disruption to patient care, ensure we fulfill the plans of care and avoid losing visits.

How, when and what should you discuss with Richard regarding his absence.
