Adding Authorizations

> Once in the patient's case, follow the below instructions:
> 
1. Click on the Insurance Tab
2. To begin entering the Authorization information, you will first want to click on the "Not Applicable" check box.
    - Clicking this check box will give you access to all of the authorization fields in order to enter the relevant information

1. Once clicked, you will have the option to select the Rule associated with the Authorization by clicking the drop-down. The drop down will provide the below options:
2. **Custom Rule:** This rule functions the same as the current system, but it is for **visual reference only** and **will not alert** for authorizations.
3. **Before Evaluation/Re-Evaluation:** Authorization is needed before the evaluation and for subsequent visits.
4. **After evaluation, but before next visit:** Authorization is not needed for the evaluation, but is needed for the visits following the evaluation.
5. **Separate auths for evaluation and treatment:** When the insurance requires a different authorization code for the evaluation AND treatment separately.

1. Next you will manually enter the authorization information the following fields are **mandatory**

> and must be completed before the program will allow you to save:
> 
1. **Authorized Visits**
2. **Authorization Number**
3. **Call Reference Number**
4. **Authorization Start**
5. **Insurance Representative** - Insurance Representative that you received the authorization from. If you receive this information online, you can just simply enter "Online" in this field.

- The **Authorization End** is the only field that is not mandatory and can be left blank when saving the authorization information for the first time.
- Another thing to keep in mind is that the authorization start date must match, or fall within the insurance date range, or it will not accept it.

1. When all Authorization information has been entered and has been verified, hit the "Create Coverage" button, or if adding it to an insurance that has already been created hit the Update Coverage button.
- ***If you do not choose either of these options after manually entering in insurance information, the system will not save the information you have just entered you will need to re-enter that information. The system will not automatically save this information for you.***
