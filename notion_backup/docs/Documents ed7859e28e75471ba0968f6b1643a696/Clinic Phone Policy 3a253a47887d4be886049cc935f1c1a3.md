Clinic Phone and Phone Transferring Policy

1. Transferring clinic phones to a buddy clinic is acceptable, when approved by CD for assistance
2. Transferring Clinic phones to a cellular phone is not acceptable as patient information can be compromised
3. Monitoring of clinic voicemails is recommended throughout the day – calling in periodically throughout the day (roughly every 2 hours)
    1. It is acceptable, during this time of the pandemic, to allow staff to return calls via a cellphone to patients in response to voicemails
    2. Under no circumstance can any employee request patients to send any information via their cell phone
    3. Staff needs to direct patients to submit questions, forms, etc., to a company email
