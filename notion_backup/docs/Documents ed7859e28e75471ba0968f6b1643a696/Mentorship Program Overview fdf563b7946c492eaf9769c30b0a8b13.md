# *Be great today and everyday moving forward*

> The Alliance Physical Therapy Partners mentoring program is a 16-week program, beginning within your first 30 days of employment. This comprehensive program is designed to accelerate the professional development of recently graduated physical therapists so they can provide a best-in class experience for their patients and build a foundation of success with the Alliance Physical Therapy Partners family.
> 
> 
> As a new graduate, you are excited to reach the final step in your journey of becoming a physical therapist. However, there is still a big learning curve once you graduate and become licensed. That learning curve not only entails the rest of your clinical experience, but also the responsibility and accountability of caring for patients, learning how to accommodate productivity goals, maintaining communication with physicians and other providers, supervising and directing staff, and maintaining a healthy work–life balance.
