Guidelines for Patient Arrivals and Screenings

1. Clinics should post a notice on the front door instructing patients to notify clinic staff via telephone prior to entering the clinic if they are experiencing fever, coughing, or shortness of breath. The posting may be accessed here: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Please-Read.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Please-Read.pdf)
2. **Only patients are allowed in the clinic.** Exceptions may be made for individuals responsible for providing essential care to patients and parents/guardians of pediatric patients.
3. Clinics should determine which of the following patient arrival protocols they will implement and communicate this to the patients via a posting on the front door of the clinic, outside the reception window and in the open gym area.
    1. **Waiting in the car:** Patients should alert clinic staff of their arrival via a telephone call to the front desk or by knocking on the front door upon arrival. Patient should return to their car and wait until a staff member comes to get them for their appointment.
    2. **Marking social distance measures in the clinic:** Patients should follow social distancing guidelines in the clinic by waiting and sitting only in the designated areas. Chairs in the waiting room should be placed 6 feet apart and marked on the floor with tape. If there will be more than 1 person in the open gym area, patients must remain at least 6 feet apart.
4. Patients and approved visitors should be screened prior to **each visit**. Please follow the following protocol:
    1. Print a copy of the schedule each day.
    2. Staff will take the temperature of each patient / approved visitor upon their entry to the building. You do not need to record the temperature if it is below 100.4*F. If it is at or above 100.4*F, patient should be instructed to reschedule the visit after they have been fever free for 24 hours. Make a note of the fever as the reason for rescheduling in patientâ€™s Agile account.
    3. Staff will read the questionnaire to the patient and follow the instructions. You can access the screening questionnaire on our intranet at Resources>Coronavirus Information & Resources>Documents>Patient Information>Patient Screen Questionnaire or at this link https://agilityhealth.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/COVID19/EQLlG4hYKDFOoAJtrxirCQkBDRMasKuLay_p68bX34 PlGQ?e=JSZn0B
    4. Staff will place a checkmark next to the patient name on the schedule after they have been screened.
    5. Schedules indicating screenings should be scanned at the end of the day and will be maintained for a period of 1 year.
5. Follow the COVID-19 Scenario Grid & Exposure Grid guidance if applicable. You can access the grid on our intranet at Resources>Coronavirus Information & Resources> COVID-19 Scenario Grid & Exposure Grid or at this link: https://agilityhealth.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/COVID19/EWXZuwT2dMhFp2nG8bdESZ0BX0BeRfPONkRfXmbg_blHT A?e=Sq6ZOv
