**SOCIAL MEDIA POLICY**

> Please read the excerpt below from the Alliance Employee Handbook and sign below.
> 
> 
> Business use of social media – that is, social media on behalf of Alliance – is prohibited absent authorization from the company. 
> 
> Only those officially designated by Alliance have the authorization to speak for the company. When communicating through social media, you must make it clear that you are not speaking on behalf of Alliance unless you have been expressly authorized to do so. You should assume that your colleagues, our patients and others may read items you post online, even if you label the information as “private”. 
> 
> Never post any information about Alliance that you know to be false. Also, do not post anything that may make yourself or Alliance to appear unprofessional. Alliance would like to remind you that there could be consequences to what you post online, so think twice before you post something on social media. Information posted online may be used by Alliance to investigate suspected misconduct or violations of company policy. 
> 
> This policy is designed to protect Alliance’s legitimate business interests, while allowing you to engage in the use of social media as freely as possible. Nothing in this policy is designed or intended to (and won’t be enforced as to) interfere with protected employee communications about important workplace issues.
