3. Add a Primary Insurance by selecting the Add icon ("+").
    1. If the patient is Self-Pay, simply check the "Patient Pay" checkbox, make sure to enter correct start/end date, and then click Create Coverage and you're done!

1. Add the Insurance Plan from the drop-down menu.
    1. if the Plan is not listed and it *is* In-Network, contact the support team to have it added.
2. Add the Subscriber.
    1. If the Subscriber is not the patient, add them in the patient’s contacts first – then add them in the insurance tab (**View Adding Emergency Contacts under Patient Overview**)
3. Enter the Patient’s First and Last Name, or select Copy Patient Information.
4. Enter the Policy Number and Group Number.
5. Enter the Deductible amount for the insurance plan.

    1. A Therapy Cap is used for insurances, such as Medicare, which have a limited dollar amount the patient can use for therapy
13. Add an Authorization
    1. If the insurance has an authorization that needs to be entered, this is where you would need to add this information. Simply uncheck the "Not Applicable" box (***For more detailed instructions for adding, editing, or removing an authorization please refer to other Adding/Editing Authorization***)
14. Adding Medical Review
    1. If the insurance requires that a Medical Review is required after a certain number of days, visits, or units billed you can enter that information here. Again, simply uncheck the "Not Applicable" checkbox for access to update this information at any time (***For a more specific overview of the Medical Review functionality, please view the Medical Review Manual***)
15. If Secondary or Tertiary Insurance information needs to be entered, you would also enter this information on this screen by selecting the "+" icon located next to either secondary or tertiary

> - ****If the wrong insurance information is entered on a patient's case by mistake, and it has not been billed, then you can change the insurance without marking it as an error. You are able to edit the insurance on the case until it is billed, to do so you would simply need to hit the add icon ("+") next to the insurance you are trying to change.*****
