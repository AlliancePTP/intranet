Patient Discharge Expectations

> In an effort to conclude our patient’s episode of care, we are implementing a discharge process for our patients with our FOCs. At the time of discharge, the clinician needs to ensure the patient’s come up front by walking them to the desk to complete the discharge process. At that time, the FOC will review the Financial Summary with the patient to collect on any outstanding balances on their account.
> 
- **If the balance is zero at discharge** = the FOC MUST inform the patient that they will be receiving a statement in the mail as all outstanding claims have not yet been processed with their insurance. Hand the patient a Business Office card to contact with questions upon receipt of statement.
- **If the patient cannot pay the full amount at discharge** = ask the patient what they can pay today and collect. Any balance remaining, plus any outstanding claims will be mailed via a statement to their home. They can pay online, mail the payment in, or if there is a need to set up a payment plan, all can then be handled with our Business Office. The FOC will hand the patient a Business Office card to contact with questions upon receipt of statement.
- **If the patient discharges via phone** = review the patient’s financials with them as you would if they were standing in the clinic. Ask for payment that you can take over the phone to be applied immediately to their account. Any balance remaining, plus outstanding claims will be mailed via a statement to their home. The 800# to our Billing Office is reflected on their statement should they have any questions or need to arrange a payment plan.
