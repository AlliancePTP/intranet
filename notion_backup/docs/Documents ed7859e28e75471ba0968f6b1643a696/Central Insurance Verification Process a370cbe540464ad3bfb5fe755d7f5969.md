The Central Insurance Verification (CIV) program is designed to aid in verifying eligibility and benefits for all new evaluations. Thus, determining and documenting **estimated** patient responsibility as well as authorization, pre-certification, and medical necessity review requirements for treatment.

**What does this mean?**

Our Insurance Verification Specialist (IVS) will maintain a recurring report that pulls all evaluations and obtain the projected eligibility and benefits for Physical Therapy services according to the patient’s insurance plan type. This is not a guarantee of benefits. Front office coordinators (FOC) will be responsible for obtaining the current and correct insurance information from the patient to allow the IVS to work efficiently.

**FOC Process:**

The FOC schedules the appointment and collects all insurance data from the patient by:

- Scanning in the insurance card (if scheduling in office)
- Completing the ‘patient intake form’ **in its entirety** and uploading the form into the ‘case files’

**Information needed for verification to be complete by the IVS:**

- **Insurance company/ Administrator/ Payer ID (information usually listed under ‘mail claims to:’ on the back of the insurance card)**
- **Patient name as it is displayed on the insurance card**
- **Subscriber/ Insurance holders name (usually the patient, patient’s spouse, or the parent of minor patient)**
    - **Full legal first and last name including suffix (JR, SR, II, III, etc.)**

> Abbreviations/ nicknames should only be used/ added to the nickname field on the ‘patient tab’.
> 
- **Policy/ subscriber/ member ID number**
- **Group number**
- **Customer service/ eligibility and benefits/ provider phone number**

**Obtain the same information for the secondary and tertiary insurances.**

The FOC is responsible for adding the correct insurance into the insurance tab of the patient’s case by verifying claims mailing address from the back of the insurance card.

After reviewing the benefits with the patient, the FOC is responsible for documenting under the insurance tab of the patient’s case in the ‘insurance notes’ section, “benefits reviewed with patient”. (As shown below)

**IVS (Insurance Verification Specialist) Process:**

1. The IVS runs a report pulling patient data for new evaluations and verifies eligibility and benefits
2. The IVS finds out if a pre-cert, authorization, or medical review/ clinical submission is required
3. The IVS will send an email to all FOC’s if further information is needed
4. The IVS will add a note on the patient appointment when complete stating “Verified Benefits” (As shown below)

- ***NOTE: If the FOC/ Patient finds discrepancies in the benefit information or questions the benefit information quoted by CIV a ticket should be sent to CIV to clarify questionable benefit.**

**Authorizations**:

The FOC’s will be responsible for obtaining authorizations, pre-certifications, and submitting records for medical review as necessary. All authorizations should try and be obtained **before evaluation** and if authorization needs to be obtained after eval it should date back to date of eval if insurance allows.

If authorization is required, the IVS will notate in the ‘insurance notes’ section, in RED that an authorization is required. (As shown below)

![Central%20Insurance%20Verification%20Process%20a370cbe540464ad3bfb5fe755d7f5969/image4.png](Central%20Insurance%20Verification%20Process%20a370cbe540464ad3bfb5fe755d7f5969/image4.png)

**Visit Limits:**

Visit/day/unit limits will be entered in the ‘medical review’ section as well as documented in the benefit summary under the ‘insurance notes’ section by the IVS.

If medical necessity review (medical review/ clinical submission) is required after a certain number of visits, then *that* visit limit will be entered in the ‘medical review’ section and trump the total number of visits.

If authorization is required after a certain number of visits, then *that* visit limit will be entered in the ‘medical review’ section and trump the total number of visits. Authorization required will also be listed in RED in the “insurance notes” section.

- Example: Patient is allowed 60 visits per calendar year, but medical necessity review (medical review/ clinical submission) is required after the 25th visit, 25 will be listed under the ‘medical review’ section. (As shown below)

If a patient is added to the schedule for the same day after 5:30 PM eastern standard time, the FOC will be responsible for verifying the patient’s benefits.

**Completed Verification:**

Once verification has been completed, the IVS will enter a PT benefit summary under the ‘insurance tab’ in the ‘insurance notes’ section.

**Extra Specific Needs:**

Please send CIV a Helpscout ticket (CIV@allianceptp.com) to verify additional benefits/ services/ special requests. (examples below)

- Aquatic
- Tens units
- Diagnosis driven specifics
- Specific CPT codes/ procedures (dry needling)

If you are unsure if CIV can verify the benefits for a certain service, please send a ticket and ask.

**Errors/ Discrepancies in CIV verification:**

If FOC notices an error with CIV verification the FOC should send a Helpscout ticket to CIV (CIV@allianceptp.com) to re-verify/ make the corrections. This will ensure the IVS will be able to see what was incorrect or missed to allow the IVS to learn for the future.

***Examples of errors/ discrepancies but not limited to:***

- Visits missing in Med Review
- Copay is different than what patient was quoted
- Missing information in benefit summary
- Insurance pop up information not filled in

**Additional Information Needed from Patient:**

If the IVS notices inconsistencies between the information insurance has listed and the information listed in the patient’s case they will enter a note in the ‘insurance notes’ section of the case and send a ticket to the FOC. These will also be entered in RED for the FOC’s to review and verify with the patient. (As shown below)

**Definitions and Abbreviations**

**Definitions:**
