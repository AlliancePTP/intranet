> Detail will show which Date of Services in that Insurance Coverage Authorization need to be addressed. A status column displays the issue. You may find explanations of these statuses below:
> 
- **Billed** – appointment was billed with a valid authorization
- **Billed w/Invalid Authorization** – appointment was billed without an authorization number
- **Acknowledged** – appointment was acknowledged, but no charges were submitted yet
- **Scheduled** – appointment is scheduled, but not yet acknowledged

> EXAMPLES: The calendar alert above states that a previous date of service was billed without authorization. Once the date of service is rebilled the calendar will no longer be red. Schedule appointments without authorization numbers assigned will also display in red until an authorization exists to cover them.
> 
> 
> If past appointments cannot be corrected, you may select the checkbox to not show highlighted past appointments without valid authorization. This alert will then be removed from view.
