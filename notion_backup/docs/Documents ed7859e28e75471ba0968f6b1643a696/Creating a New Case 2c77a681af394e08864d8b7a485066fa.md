Creating a Case for a New Patient

> Below are the steps on how to create a new case for a patient who does not have any previous cases (episodes of care) within AgileRPM.
> 
1. Always search for a patient before creating a new on the Patient tab.
    1. If a patient does not already exist in AgileRPM, a message will say “There are currently no records in the system.”
2. Select New Case

To create a new case, the following information is required and needs to be entered:

1. Case Type (Documentation/Non-Documentation)
    1. Documentation - Case where electronic documents will be filled out (e.g. Initial Evaluation, Plan of Care, Daily Notes etc)
    2. Non-Documentation - Case where no electronic documents will be filled out (e.g. DME, Massage, Gym, or legacy cases from past systems where we are performing charge entry only)
2. First Name
3. Last Name
4. Date of Birth
5. Phone Number

1. Select “Go”
2. AgileRPM will suggest possible matches to MRN’s which have a similar last name or DOB.
    1. If none of the suggestions match the patient, select Create Case.
3. A new Case number and new MRN will be created.
4. Obtain the following information from the patient and fill it in the respected tabs.
    1. Patient Address
    2. Email Address
    3. Referral information
    4. Insurance information
5. Any addition information can be documented during the patient’s initial evaluation, once they have completed their new patient paperwork packet. (unless you already have it)
    1. (i.e.) Patient Contacts, Communication Subscriptions, Marketing Sources, etc.
