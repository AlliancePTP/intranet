Reschedule and Cancel Guidelines

Hi Alliance FO Teams,

While I have been making my way out to meet each of you, those I haven’t yet, I do plan to do so in the near future and look forward to getting to know all of you.

At this time, I wanted to send a reminder to all of you as it has come to my attention some questions surrounding our Cancel vs Reschedule policy and how to handle them.  We should always be explaining to our patients at the time of Eval, our scheduling best practices which includes how we handle cancelation calls.  That should they need to cancel, we will automatically reschedule their appt to another day and time that best fits their schedule within the same work week.  Things do happen and life gets in the way, but we all need to do our due diligence in adhering to the frequency & duration indicated, the best we can.  Below is a summary of how we should be handling those calls.

- A **Reschedule** is if a patient calls to reschedule their currently scheduled appt **WITHIN the SAME WORK WEEK**
- A **Cancel** is if a patient calls to change their current week appt to a date outside of the **CURRENT WORK WEEK**

In order to Reschedule an appt, the user must select the “Reschedule” button from the originally scheduled appt, and either select a different day from the drop-down dates or moving to another timeslot within the current day.  We would only select the “Cancel” button if the patient was not rescheduling within the current work week.  (NOTE:  Those of you not yet on Agile, you will learn this tool, but the concept of cancel vs reschedule remains the same).

I hope this provides some clarity around this cancel topic.  Should you have any other questions, always feel free to let me know.

Thank you and let’s make it a great rest of the week.

Linda
