**Gaining Agreement with Your Treatment Approach**

Physician Liaisons

When you are visiting Physician offices, it is important to gain maximum agreement from the referring doctors. Too often, when a PT goes out, he will attempt to “educate” the doctor. Sometimes the PT will share unique treatment approaches in an effort to stand out as being special to the physician and different from the competitors. I believe when you are doing this, you could be on shaky ground.

You want to create a **“maximum nod your head factor.”** You are searching for agreement. If the doc agrees with what you are saying, he will like you more. If he likes you more, he will send you more patients.

It is easy to identify the docs who like you. Look over your top referring docs. I bet they like you? The ones that don’t refer much, or not at all, don’t like you. Your job when visiting doctors is to raise the “likeability quotient” in the minds of those referring doctors.

If you bring up a controversial treatment approach during your conversation (in other words, something the doc does not necessarily agree with) he will not like you quite as much, and he will refer less.

Here is another point to remember, **never tell them how you do what you do?** There is too much of a chance for disagreement when explaining away your treatment approach. You could lose the maximum nod your head factor and the potential referral.

Let’s say that the doctor asks you, “*What is your approach to treating back pain?*” Here is an example of a wrong answer: “*We use a McKenzie approach…*” Why? Because now you must cross your fingers and hope that the doc is cool with a McKenzie approach. You are now uncertain that you can maintain the maximum nod your head factor. If he responds with, “I hate McKenzie”, you have a problem. What do you say now? He is no longer in agreement with you and you’ve lost potential spine referrals.

It is important to have in your arsenal, a go-to handling when asked about your approach to treating “X”. What I am about to cover is easier for the Business Development Manager to do than the PT, but believe me, it will work just fine when a PT applies this approach.

**The 4 Phase Approach**

Let’s say that the doctor asks you, “*What is your approach to treating back pain?*” Your go to should be the 4 Phase Approach.

You would say:

***“Doctor, we have a 4 Phase Approach to treating (back, knee, shoulder, hip) pain.***

***“During Phase I, we focus on reducing the patient’s pain and inflammation.***

***“In Phase II, we move our attention over to improving range of motion and joint mobility, while being careful not exacerbate the pain and inflammation.***

***“In Phase III, we add in strengthening, core stability, balance and coordination (if appropriate) exercises throughout the full range of motion.***

***“Lastly, in Phase IV we intensify the program with aerobic and endurance activities so that the patient can return to work, sport or resume normal activities of daily living.”***

Believe it or not, a doctor will nod his head throughout your presentation of this 4 Phase Approach explanation. Not one doctor would disagree with you when you tell them that you work to get the pain and inflammation under control in Phase I. The same is true for all of the phases.

If you are using this approach as a PT, don’t deviate from the script. **DO NOT** tell the doctor how you do what you do for each of the steps. Make him ask. You will be surprised to find out that he will rarely ask for details. If, on the far chance that he does, answer ONLY with things that he will agree with. Don’t talk about using a cold laser to reduce pain and inflammation or dry needling or anything that could be considered anything less than 100% agreement.

It is worth drilling how to present the 4 Phased Approach so that you have it cold. It is astonishing how well this works. Try it!

Best,
