**FAX ANNOUNCEMENTS THROUGH SFAX**

CREATE SHARED GROUP

Since faxes are mostly sent to physicians from Agile, a group shared folder within SFax for any mass emails sent to referring physicians was created.

The Physician Referral Trending report lists any physician that referred 1+ patient in a given date range. Unfortunately, the fax number is not included on this report. Copy the fax number from Agile.

Create Contact – Enter Physician’s fax number, select Shared Contact and type the physician first and last name and click next. Single left click on the box next to Physicians Referrals. This will not only add the entry to the shared contact but also the Physicians Referrals group.

Do this at the end of the day so faxes are sent throughout the night. It is less likely to get busy tones.
