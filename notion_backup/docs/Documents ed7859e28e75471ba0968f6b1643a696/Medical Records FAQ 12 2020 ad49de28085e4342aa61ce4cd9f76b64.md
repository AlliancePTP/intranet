> 
> **Question:** What if the requester sends a second request?
> 
> **Answer:** You should forward the request to [medrecs@allianceptp.com](mailto:medrecs@allianceptp.com) , label the email as usual in the subject line and add ‘2nd Request’. **No other information is necessary. It is also not necessary to call Medical Records to inquire about the 2nd request.**
> 
> **Question:** How long will it take for the records to be produced?
> 
> **Answer:** Our Medical Records Coordinator follows federal and state guidelines that govern medical record production timelines. Federal HIPAA guidelines allow 30 days from the date the request was received. In many cases, the request will be processed before the 30-day timeline; however, some requests require communication between us and the requesting party. That is why it is important that you direct all questions to our medical records department. In the event that the state guidelines are more restrictive that the federal guidelines, the state guidelines will be followed.
> 
> **Question:** What if the request says it is an emergency or the records are needed ASAP?
> 
> **Answer:** Once the request is received by the Medical Records Department, it will be reviewed by the Medical Records Coordinator and prioritized accordingly.
> 
> **Question:** What if a patient comes to the office and requests their medical records? Can I print them out and give it to them?
> 
> **Answer:** Yes, it is appropriate (and good customer service) to immediately print out records for a patient when they are requested in person. Front office staff should first verify the person’s ID and then make a note in the patient’s account regarding what records were provided to them. The ID may be a government issued Photo- ID, Driver’s License, or Passport.
> 
> **Question:** Can a patient request their records over the phone?
> 
> **Answer:** Yes, IF the patient contacts the Medical Records Department directly. Please note that requests received via telephone in the clinic and then emailed to the Medical Records Department will not be processed. If a patient calls the clinic to request their records, please do one of the following:
> 
- Direct them to the online request form. If they cannot access the online form;
- Provide them with the telephone number for the Medical Records Department.
