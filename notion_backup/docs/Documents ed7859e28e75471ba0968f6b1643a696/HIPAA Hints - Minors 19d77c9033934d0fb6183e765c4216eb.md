# Parent is generally the minor’s personal representative.

> The parent of an unemancipated minor generally is that minor’s personal representative and may act on behalf of the minor in that capacity. A parent that is a minor’s personal representative can exercise all rights to the minor’s PHI that would be available to the minor, e.g. right to access, amendment and accounting; unless such access is not consistent with State or other law.

- The minor’s custodial parent.
- The minor’s noncustodial parent unless there is a court order limiting the noncustodial parent’s access

- The minor’s legal guardian.
- For minors whose parents’ parental rights have been terminated, the probate court or agency having

# Parent is NOT personal representative.

> A parent is not the minor’s personal representative and does not “stand in the shoes” of a minor child with respect to PHI in three situations:
> 
1. When the minor is the one who consents to care and the consent of the parent is not required under State or other applicable law;
2. When the minor obtains care at the direction of a court or a person appointed by the court; and
3. When and to the extent that, the parent agrees that the minor and the health care provider may have a confidential relationship.

> However, even in these situations, the parent may have access to the medical records of the minor related to treatment when State or other applicable law requires or permits such parental access.
> 

# Parental Rights Terminated.

> If a parent’s parental rights have been terminated then the parent is not the minor’s personal representative and cannot disclose PHI to the parents as the minor’s personal representative. Need an authorization or court order to disclose PHI to a parent whose parental rights have been terminated.
> 

# Exception in cases of Domestic Violence, Abuse or Neglect.

> As is the case with respect to all personal representatives under the Privacy Rule, a provider may choose not to treat a parent as a personal representative when the provider reasonably believes, in his or her professional judgment, that the child has been or may be subjected to domestic violence, abuse or neglect, or that treating the parent as the child’s personal representative could endanger the child.
