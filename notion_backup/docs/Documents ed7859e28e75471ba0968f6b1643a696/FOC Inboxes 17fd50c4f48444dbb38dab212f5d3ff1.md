Please refer to this list below of all the Alliance clinic’s shared mailboxes. Each FOC for each corresponding clinic should be a member of at least one of these. If you are not, please reach out to the HelpDesk and we will add you to the correct location. It’s best to just send us a ticket to [helpdesk@allianceptp.com](mailto:helpdesk@allianceptp.com) in this situation.
