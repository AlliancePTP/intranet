**CANCELLATION AND NO SHOW POLICY**

Our goal is to provide quality individualized medical care in a timely manner. No-shows, late shows and cancellations inconvenience those individuals who need access to medical care. We would like to remind you of our policy regarding missed appointments.

**Cancellation of an Appointment**

In order to be respectful of the medical needs of other patients, please be courteous and call our office promptly if you are unable to show up for an appointment. This time will be reallocated to someone who is in need of treatment. If it is necessary to cancel your scheduled appointment, we require that you call at least 24 hours in advance. Appointments are in high demand, and your early cancellation will allow another patient access to timely medical care.

**How to Cancel Your Appointment**

To cancel your appointment, please call (insert phone number). If you do not reach the front desk coordinator, you may leave a detailed message on our voice mail. If you would like to reschedule your appointment, please leave your name and phone number. We will return your call promptly.

**Late Cancellations:** A cancellation is considered to be late when the appointment is cancelled without a 24-hour advance notice.

**No Shows:** A “no-show”, is a patient who misses an appointment without cancelling it.

Late cancellations and no-show instances will be recorded in the patient’s chart.

**The first time there is a “no-show”, late cancellation, or cancellation without a reasonable excuse there will be no charge to the patient.**

**A 2nd occurrence will result in a fee of $25.00.**

**The 3rd occurrence will be the fee of $25.00 and the patient may be discharged from the practice.**
