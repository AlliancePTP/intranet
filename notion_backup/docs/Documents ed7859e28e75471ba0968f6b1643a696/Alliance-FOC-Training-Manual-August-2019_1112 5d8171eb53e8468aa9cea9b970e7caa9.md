# Lost Patients (MIAs):

> The goal of MIAs is to try to get patients back into the schedule as soon as possible or to close out charts that are still currently active if they should not be. The goal is to reactivate the patient, not to discharge them. This should be worked on a weekly basis (Tuesday) by utilizing the Case Inactivity Report in the Portal Reports.
> 
> 
> The purpose of this is to ensure that all patients complete their fully prescribed PT treatment programs. It is vital to reactivate a lost patient as quickly as possible or the chances that they will return decrease rapidly.
>

> Handle the MIAs following the steps listed below:
> 
> 
> **START DATE -** The date of the patient’s last missed appointment or last appointment attended with no more appointments scheduled. This is the **START DATE** of the MIA cycle and the MIA list will need to be run weekly to address any patients that have gone MIA.
> 
1. The **Front Office Coordinator** will call that day (**call #1**) to try to reschedule. If they cannot speak directly to the patient with the first call, leave a message if able, to call you back. If no RESPONSE from the patient in 24 hours, attempt a 2nd call (**call # 2**). If you are still unable to reach the patient, notify the P.T. for next steps.
2. If the clinician indicates that they will DC the patient, the FOC will DC the patient in Agile which will send an alert to the PT to complete the discharge note.

> Please use the following scripts as examples of how to handle MIAs. Be sure to stress to the patient that you are concerned you have not heard from them and that they have not reached their full rehabilitation potential. Our goal is not to discharge these patients, it is our goal to reactivate these patients and get them to complete their treatment plans.
> 
> 
> The above steps are to be completed in a 72-hour time frame from the day the patients last scheduled visit took place.
> 

## Insurance and Authorization concerns regarding MIAs:

> Limitations need to be checked with CIV upon return of treatment pending the duration the patient has been absent from care. This will determine next steps and whether a new script or authorization needs to be obtained.
> 
> 
> **Sample script:**
> 
> Call #1: “Hi, (patient name). This is (your name) from (Company Name & Location). I wanted to check in with you because I see that you don’t have any more visits scheduled and it looks like (PT name) was supposed to be seeing you   x this week. I’ve got an opening at   am/pm today to get you in.
> 
> Please give me a call back ASAP to schedule that appointment and get you back on track!”
> 
> Call #2 (made by PT) “Hi (patient name). This is (clinician name) from (Company Name & location). I
> 
> know you’re probably busy but I was concerned when I found out from (FOC name) you hadn’t called back after she called you.” Then go to situations examples below:
> 
> **Situation A: Patient on hold due to further clinical work-up.**
> 
> “I’m sorry if I didn’t make it clear to you on your last visit to schedule   more visits. You are really making such great progress (if they are) and I know we can get you even better with just these last few visits. I would hate to see you get worse or go backward after all that hard work you put in. Please call today at (phone number) and let me know if you have any questions. Look forward to seeing you soon.”
> 
> **Situation B: Patient N/S or Canceled for last appointments.**
> 
> “I would hate to see your progress with your   stop or even get worse. If you’re not happy with the progress you made or care you received, I really need to know that too. So, could you please call (your name) at (phone number) today and let us know how we can help to get you to your goal!
> 
> Thanks for taking the time to let me know.”
> 

# Patient on Hold Policy:

> Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all patients complete their fully prescribed PT treatment programs. It is vital to follow-up with any patient that is placed on hold on a weekly basis. This will ensure they are rescheduled as quickly as possible; the chances that they will return decrease rapidly over time. It will also help to write timely discharge notes.
> 
> 
> **Who is responsible:** The treating PT and Front Office Coordinator.
> 
> How to put a patient on hold:
> 
1. Open the patient’s case, make sure you are on the home screen.
2. Select Place Case Hold, right side of the screen
3. The Place the Case on Hold window will open
    1. Select the reason
    2. Assign the duration
    3. Save

![Alliance-FOC-Training-Manual-August-2019_1112%205d8171eb53e8468aa9cea9b970e7caa9/image110.jpeg](Alliance-FOC-Training-Manual-August-2019_1112%205d8171eb53e8468aa9cea9b970e7caa9/image110.jpeg)

1. Patient will now show up in your work queue as being on hold.

> Following up with patients on hold:
> 
1. **Front Office Coordinator** will call exactly 1 week from the date the patient was put on hold or the specific date entered in case hold. (**Call #1**) to try to reschedule. If you do not reach the patient, leave them a voicemail message to call you back. If no RESPONSE from the patient in 48 hours, **call # 2** needs to be made. If after the 2nd call and no response, refer to the clinician.
2. **Front Office Coordinator** will give the information to the P.T. to call the patient that day.
3. Please use the scripts above as examples of how to handle this. Be sure to stress to the patient that you are concerned you have not heard from them and want to know what is happening since they have left.

> Tips for handling MIAs:
> 
- Do NOT lose track of these patients – all MIAs should be handled or DC within 72 – 96 hours of going MIA
- If 48 hours has passed with no activity from the PT, by pass and go to Call 3

> DC routing:
> 
1. Document communication or information in the Clinical Note
2. Discharge the patient case in Agile

> This will add the DC note to the correct therapist’s work queue for completion.
>
