> To search for either active or discharged patient cases, follow these steps:
> 
1. Click **Cases** on the Agile menu bar.

1. Use the **filter fields** at the top of the case list to search for cases.
2. Start typing in any of the blank fields above a column. Agile will begin to filter as information is entered.
3. A couple of the filter fields have drop-down menus. Select an item from the list, and Agile will filter the cases based on the category selected.
4. Enter data in multiple fields to narrow the search.
5. Click the **Edit icon** to the right of the case record to go to the Case Home page for that patient.

> Note: If searching for an Active case, the quick search field in the upper left of the screen can also be used.
> 
- In the quick search field, begin typing the patient's first or last name, MRN, or case number.
- When the case appears in the list below the field, click on it.
