HIPAA HINTS

1. **DO NOT include PHI on the fax cover sheet.** The fax cover sheet should include:
    1. Sender’s name, facility, telephone and fax number;
    2. Number of pages being faxed, including the cover sheet
    3. Intended recipient’s name, facility, telephone, and fax number
    4. Confidentiality statement
        1. Documents that contain highly confidential PHI (mental health, substance abuse treatment, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases) should not be faxed (see #3 below for further guidance)
        2. Confirm the fax number with the recipient prior to sending PHI
    5. LIMIT the amount of information being faxed to the MINIMUM AMOUNT NECESSARY
2. **Faxing of highly confidential information is not recommended.** Faxing of highly confidential information is only permitted if the sender first calls the recipient and confirms that the recipient or his/her designee can be waiting at the fax machine, and then, the recipient or his/her designee waits at the fax machine to receive the fax and then calls the sender to confirm receipt of the document. Both the sender and the recipient must be attentive to the sensitive nature of highly confidential information. Highly Confidential Information includes the following:
3. If the fax was transmitted to the wrong recipient, in all cases follow these steps:
    1. Fax a request to the incorrect fax number explaining that the information has been misdirected and ask that the materials be returned or destroyed.
    2. Notify the HIPAA Privacy Officer of the error; and
    3. Verify the fax number with the recipient before attempting to fax the information again.
4. A few notes on fax machines:
    1. Fax machines used for sending and receiving patient information must be placed in a secure location.
    2. Incoming faxes should be removed timely from the output tray and distributed to the recipient to reduce the chance of an inappropriate use or disclosure.
    3. Pre-programmed numbers should be validated periodically, and regular fax recipients should be reminded to provide notification in the event their incoming fax number changes.
    4. Fax machines should be set to print the incoming fax number at the top of the page and a confirmation sheet.
