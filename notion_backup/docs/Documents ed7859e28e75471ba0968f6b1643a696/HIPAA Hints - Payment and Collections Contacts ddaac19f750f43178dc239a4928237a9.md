> HIPAA allows healthcare providers to use or disclose protected health information (PHI) for the purpose of obtaining payment without the patient’s consent or authorization unless the provider has agreed otherwise with the patient.
> 
> An FAQ document published by the Office for Civil Rights states the following:
> 
> **Question:** Does the HIPAA Privacy Rule permit a covered entity or its collection agency to communicate with parties other than the patient (e.g., spouses or guardians) regarding payment of a bill?
> 
> **Answer:** Yes. The Privacy Rule permits a covered entity, or a business associate acting on behalf of a covered entity (e.g., a collection agency), to disclose protected health information as necessary to obtain payment for health care, and does not limit to whom such a disclosure may be made.
> 
> Therefore, a covered entity, or its business associate, may contact persons other than the individual as necessary to obtain payment for health care services. See [45 CFR 164.506](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2003-title45-vol1/xml/CFR-2003-title45-vol1-sec164-506.xml)(c) and the definition of “payment” at [45 CFR](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2003-title45-vol1/xml/CFR-2003-title45-vol1-sec164-501.xml)

However, the Privacy Rule requires a covered entity, or its business associate, to reasonably limit the amount of information disclosed for such purposes to the minimum necessary, as well as to abide by any reasonable requests for confidential communications and any agreed-to restrictions on the use or disclosure of protected health information. See [45 CFR 164.502](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2003-title45-vol1/xml/CFR-2003-title45-vol1-sec164-502.xml)(b), [164.514](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2003-title45-vol1/xml/CFR-2003-title45-vol1-sec164-514.xml)(d), and [164.522](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2003-title45-vol1/xml/CFR-2003-title45-vol1-sec164-522.xml).

> This is an important point when considering how to structure a patient collections process. The decision to contact a patient’s spouse, parents or other third parties to obtain payments is allowed if:
> 
- Minimum necessary standard is applied
- There is no agreement in place between the provider and the patient to restrict the information
