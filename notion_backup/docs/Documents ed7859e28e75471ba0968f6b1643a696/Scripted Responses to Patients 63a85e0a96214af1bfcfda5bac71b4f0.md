**Suggested Scripted Responses to Patients**

***We always need to refrain from “asking”; rather, be confident in managing your office and explaining best practices to every patient. Refrain allowance of a yes or no answer to your questions.***

**Q:** Patient calls to cancel appt due to any reason other than a clinical-related cancel

**A:** **What doesn’t work for you, the time or the day? Offer 2 more timeslots that same week to reschedule. If those don’t work, offer 2 more (dual-option close)**

**Q:** Patient calls to cancel appt due to being in pain

**A: I’m sorry to hear this; but, let me get your clinician for you to advise next steps and to help get you some relief**

**Q:** Patient states they cannot schedule any appts next week because they do not have their schedule, they work swing shift, or I have appts made and forgot my calendar, etc., etc.

**A:** **What is your preference, morning or afternoon? We ask that you schedule all appts at the time of your initial evaluation. While we understand you may not be able to make every one of them, please know that we are flexible in rescheduling that to another preferred date & time the same week. With scheduling in advance, it allows you to plan your schedule around therapy and be able to get the ideal timeslots you prefer as well as allows us to plan for appropriate staff in our clinics.**

**Q:** Patient has a $30 copay due at Time of Service

**A: Your insurance states you have a $30 copay – how would you be taking care of that today?**

**Q:** Patient cannot pay their copay at Time of Service

**A: How much can you pay today? You can pay a reduced amount every visit if that’s easier for you. Please know that any balance at the conclusion of therapy will still be your responsibility; but, know you can pay an increased amount over time when you have it, in order to have a smaller balance at time of discharge.**

**Q:** Patient’s insurance has paid on several DOS and the claims are complete, leaving a balance for the patient

**A: Your insurance has paid their portion on DOS xx/xx/2020 and now stating that the balance is your responsibility, which is a result of your (coinsurance, deductible, or outstanding copays – you need to review patient’s chart to determine). How would you be taking care of that today?**
