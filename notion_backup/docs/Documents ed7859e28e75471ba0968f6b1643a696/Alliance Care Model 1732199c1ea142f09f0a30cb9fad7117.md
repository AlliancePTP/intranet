# **Alliance Care Model**

The goal of our care model is to provide patients with compliant quality care in a fiscally responsible manner that achieves great clinical outcomes. How do we do this?

## **Fundamentals of the Alliance Care Model**

- Centered Upon Evidenced Based Best Practice.
- Manual Therapy and Exercise-Based.
- Comprehensive Patient Care Delivery.
- Flexible Model Tailored to the Patient's Needs. (One size does NOT fit all)
- Functional and Wellness Component.
- Holistic Approach to General Dysfunction and Deconditioning.

## **Goal: Optimal patient recovery.**

### Defining Characteristics

- On average, patients are in the clinic for 60-75-minutes.
- Hands-on component in EVERY treatment.
- Clinician utilizes a wide array of time-based “skilled” codes in treatment session.
- There is a functional component based upon the patient’s rehab goals.
- A cardio component is a strong part of the patient’s rehabilitation program.
- A strong and engaging patient education component with weekly review and progression.
- Modalities and other “unskilled” codes are not included in the 60–75-minute period. They would be in addition to this time.

## Result: World-class customer experience.
