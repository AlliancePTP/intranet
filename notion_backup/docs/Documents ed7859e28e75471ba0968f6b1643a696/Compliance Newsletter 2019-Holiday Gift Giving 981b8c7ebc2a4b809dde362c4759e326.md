Compliance Newsletter Holiday Gifts

# Tiffany Warden-Lewis, CPC, CPCO, Compliance Officer Christa Bringas, PT, Clinical Auditing and Education Manager

> It’s the most wonderful time of the year again! As we begin to make plans for Holiday gifts and appreciations we must keep in mind that there are guidelines we are required to follow, both corporate and regulatory. I want to take this opportunity to summarize those guidelines with you.
> 
> 
> **Federal Regulatory Guidelines –** The **Civil Monetary Penalties Law (CMPL)** prohibits healthcare providers from providing incentives to patients insured under a federal health plan unless they are of nominal value. The **Anti- Kickback Statute (AKS)** prohibits soliciting, offering, giving, or receiving remuneration in exchange for referrals for items or services covered by federal healthcare programs (*e.g.*, Medicare and Medicaid) unless it falls under a safe harbor exception or is of nominal value. The OIG has defined nominal value as:
> 

# Value not greater than $15 per gift, and;

- **Value of multiple gifts not greater than $75 in the aggregate for the calendar year**

> The Stark Law (Stark) prohibits healthcare providers from accepting monetary compensation (this includes cash and gift cards) from another provider if there is an existing financial relationship between the two entities. Stark does allow the exchange of non-monetary compensation if they gift meets the following requirements:
> 
- The gift(s) do not exceed $398 in the aggregate for the calendar year, and;
- The gifts do not take into account the number of patient referrals received from the gifted provider

> Corporate Policy – Because the Office of Inspector General (OIG) updates their policies from time to time, Alliance’s corporate policy states that we will follow all applicable federal and state guidelines. Specifically, our policy states, “The employees and contractors of Alliance Physical Therapy Partners and each of its affiliated entities (collectively, "Alliance") have a responsibility to act in a manner consistent with all applicable laws with respect to referral sources.
