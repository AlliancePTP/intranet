What is Baseline Testing?

- A method to incorporate functional activities into a rehab program to prepare a worker for
return to work duties.

Why do Functional Baseline Testing (FBT)?

- Provides therapists an objective starting point for patients so progressions can be performed
safely and timely.

When should FBT be conducted in a rehab program?

- When a patient is ready to begin working on required postures and positions assumed at work
safely.
- When an acute patient enters the strengthening phase of a physical rehab program.
- When an acute patient is appropriate to transfer to a work cond/hardening program.

How is Functional Baseline Testing done?

- Job Description from employer should be in hand or job description from [Occupationalinfo.org](http://occupationalinfo.org/).
- Assess Material Handling (F to W lift, W to S lift, Lift and carry, Push/Pull, Overhead reach)
- Assess non-material handling (aerobic, positional tolerance, progressive resistance exercise).
- Assess effort and form.
- Goals coordinate with job description – functional goal setting.
- Program includes conditioning, stretching, work simulation and strength training focusing on
return to work deficits.
- A treatment plan is written and reviewed with the patient on day 1 in work cond/hardening.
- Every week goals attainment is reviewed and new goals (if applicable) are set for the following
week. Patient initials treatment plan along with therapist.
- Every 2 weeks or at Progress note time, a new FBT is performed.
- If plateau is reached, 1 of the following discharge pathways can occur:
o Goals met for return to full-duty work – this is ALWAYS THE IDEAL OUTCOME!
o Goals not met/patient does not reach desired PDL.
▪ FCE recommended
▪ Vocational Counseling-discuss with case manager

## Example: A patient is assessed for Material Handling at a L PDL-being able to lift 2 5 # safely and with

good form. This patient needs to lift 50# occasional for full duty return to work. How do you progress
this patient in a 4-week program so they reach their required PDL?

- Progressions should occur approximately every 3 visits, increasing the lift wt. by 3-5#. So
lift progressions happen If increasing wt. causes unsafe lifting mechanics, then
increasing sets/reps may be your progression that time.
- Goal wt. of 40 - 50# can be achieved by 4 th week. See lift frequency below.

## Material Weight Guidelines for assessing Frequency

- **Seldom:** 1 rep, increase wt. 5- 10 # until reach max appropriate or form/safety are
compromised.
- **Occasional:** 3 - 6 reps, increase wt. 5-10# until reach max appropriate or form/safety are
compromised.
- **Frequent:** 10+ reps OR 4 reps of floor to waist/waist to shoulder in 20 seconds, increase
wt. 5-10# until max appropriate or form/safety are compromised.
- **Sled or Push/Pull** : Document wt. loaded in sled or FORCE required. If no force gauge in
clinic, okay to report wt. and also document distance/reps.
- **Lift/Carry** : Document distance traveled, bilateral and/or unilateral and wt. carried.

Occasional tolerances are most often reported, but refer to the patient’s specific job requirements when
testing so there is accuracy with the job demands.
