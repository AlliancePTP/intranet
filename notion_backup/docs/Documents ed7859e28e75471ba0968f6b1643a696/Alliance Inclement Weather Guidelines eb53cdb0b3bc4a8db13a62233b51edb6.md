**Inclement Weather**

Inclement weather will occur on an infrequent basis.  Preparation for such events is critical to ensure the safety of both our staff and patients, continued delivery of care and achieving fiscal responsibility. Taking a proactive approach will guarantee success in managing visits and meeting our responsibilities to patients.

As professionals, we have an obligation to our patients and referring physicians to fulfill the plan of care set at the initial evaluation.  As for sickness and vacation, the expectation during any week that has inclement weather is we continue to deliver the same visit frequency as any other week. This will likely require clinicians and support staff to flex schedules to achieve this goal.  An inclement weather day should not be assumed a whole day off.  If roads are bad in the morning, if you can safely, still make every effort to arrive at some point during the work day.

As for any normal week, unless there are extenuating reasons, the expectation is that missed patient appointments are rescheduled in the same week.  Explaining general expectations at the time of initial evaluation should help patients remain engaged and committed to meeting their plan of care frequency.

**Prior to Inclement Weather**

In coordination with your Office Manager and Clinical Leader it is necessary to determine the likely impact of the impending inclement weather to determine if it is safe and practical to keep normal hours of operation or adjust accordingly.  Any change in regular operating hours must be discussed and agreed upon with the Clinical Leadership.

If significant disruption is expected due to the impending inclement weather, the Clinic Director must communicate expectations to clinic staff as it pertains to any changes to hours of operations and schedules, including changes to start / finish times and opening on Saturdays.

If your clinic cancelation and no-show rate is above the normal percentage amount the expectation is that we open on Saturday for sufficient time to capture missed visits.

Proactive communicate with patients who are scheduled during the anticipated inclement weather to advise them the clinic is planning on being open. If there is a change to clinic hours of operation the relevant patients must be contacted beforehand to proactively reschedule the same week.

Go over possible messaging/action plan to Front Office staff & Clinicians re: handling CXL phone calls and how to proactively call patients to reschedule

Any week where there has been disruption due to inclement weather, the expectation is that clinics are open on Saturday and staffed appropriately.

Clinic Directors should remove all non-treatment blocks to provide additional time for rescheduled patient visits. The priority must be patient care.

**P**rint out schedules and patient contact information in case of power outages

**Day of Inclement Weather**

Any staff who are likely to be late must speak directly to Clinic Director in a timely manner prior to their normal start time. An estimated arrival time should be provided to the Clinic Director to assist with planning patient care.

Any employee that cannot make it into the clinic for either part or all of the day will be expected to add additional patient care hours onto their days throughout the remainder of the week to care for our patients,

If patients call to cancel their appointments, the employee that fields the call with offer an alternative appointment later in the day or throughout the week to maintain the patient’s POC.

In conjunction with managing the schedule, the front office staff should run the Patient cancel/no show report to assist in calling those patients who cancelled due to weather and were not already rescheduled when the cancel call came in.

Clinicians must be flexible with their schedules to accommodate patients who arrive late or scheduled later in the day. No patient should be turned away.

When appropriate, **s**end hourly staff home as able (PTAs, Rehab Techs, Front Office) or, if sure of conditions, have some not come in at all.

Consolidate salaried staff hours as able to send some home during that time so they can come in later in week &/or on Saturday.

Ensure effective use of any unavoidable down-time for salaried staff (writing extra cards to patients or physicians, Caseload Rounds, ensuring all EMR including D/Cs is up-to-date, doc reviews, etc.)

**Following the episode of inclement weather**

**Celebrate team members going above and beyond to deliver exceptional patient care and customer experiences during the inclement weather.**

Following an episode of inclement weather there are likely to be challenges associated with lower NP volume and reduced scheduling out of existing patients. It is important to get back to ‘business as usual’ as soon as possible.

Clinicians need to make sure they have scheduled their patients for next week appropriately.  If not have a clinic staff member telephone them at the earliest opportunity.

- Ask for an update from every clinician each day to determine who still needs to be scheduled for the following week
- Make sure the Plan of Care frequency matches actual scheduled frequency
- All new patients scheduled to start care have at least a second appointment booked the same week (unless contraindicated or contrary to physician prescription)
- Aim to schedule patients three weeks out (when insurance constraints / visit count restrictions allow)
- Coordinate with the front office about prioritizing evaluations to rebuild the patient population. You may need to scrub and condense the schedule to give them spots to put new evaluations.
- Any patient that is not scheduled out at least 6-8 visits should have a reason (insurance limitation, specific D/C date etc). If your clinicians don’t have a reason then they need to call all of those patients and get them scheduled.

**Inclement Weather & Payroll Explanation**

**Hourly, non-exempt employees**

They are not paid if they don’t work. They should try to make up hours if needed. Otherwise, the time is considered as PTO or unpaid, at the discretion of the Clinic Director.

**Exempt, salaried employees:**

They will need to make up the patient care hours missed if they work a partial day, as we cannot deduct from their pay and they will get paid for a full day if they do a partial day.

If they do not come in at all and they are scheduled to work, they should use PTO. If the clinic is closed they get paid.
