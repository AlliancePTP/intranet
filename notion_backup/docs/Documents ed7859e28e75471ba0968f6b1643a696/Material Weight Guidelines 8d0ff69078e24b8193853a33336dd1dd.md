# Material Weight Guidelines for assessing Frequency/Tolerance

## 4 Main Material Weight Handling Activities-

## Push/pull Floor to Waist lift Waist to shoulder lift Lift and Carry

## (Could include Shoulder to overhead and grip strength)

## Testing for baseline-

**Seldom:** 1 rep, increase wt. 5-10# until reach max appropriate or form/safety are compromised.

**Occasional:** 3 - 6 reps, increase wt. 5-10# until reach max appropriate or form/safety are compromised.

**Frequent:** 10+ reps OR 4 reps of floor to waist/waist to shoulder in 20 seconds, increase wt. 5-10# until max appropriate or form/safety are compromised.

**Sled or Push/Pull:** Document wt. loaded in sled or FORCE required. If no force gauge in clinic, okay to report wt. and also document distance/reps.

**Lift/Carry:** Document distance traveled, bilateral and/or unilateral and wt. carried.

Occasional tolerances are most often reported. Should refer to the patient’s specific job requirements when testing so there is accuracy with the job demands.

**Example:** A patient lifts 45# as their 1 rep max safe floor to waist lift upon Evaluation. They would start or resume therapy program at approximately ½ of that weight (22-25#) for their initial circuit lifts at 2nd visit and beyond. Progress weight and/or reps and sets approximately every 2-3 sessions, or at least every week, depending on frequency of visits and what time frame of reaching goal PDL level safely and efficiently. This is most often used in Work Conditioning program-but can be utilized in acute PT care when applicable.

## Symptom ratio: Time given continuously is Time per hour (__x 8 = __ in 8 hr. day)

```
Lifts Per Hour Per Day (7 hr here) % of Day
Constant 60 420 67 - 100 1: 45 secs.
Frequent 40 280 34 - 66 1: 90 secs.
Occasional 20 140 3 - 33 1: 3 minutes
Seldom 1 7 - 8 1 - 2 1: 1 hour
```

## Positional Tolerances: Sitting, standing, eye level work in standing, work bent over/stooping, kneeling

```
Positional Tolerance-
Continuous Minutes

```

```
Hours in an 8 hr. day Frequency

```

```
15 minutes 1 - 2 hours On a seldom basis
30 minutes 2 - 4 hours On an occasional basis
45 minutes 4 - 5 hours On an occasional to frequent
basis
60 minutes 6 hours On a frequent to constant basis
120 minutes 8 hours Unrestricted

```

# Use your clinical reasoning and judgement to fully evaluate the patient based on their individual needs, job demands and tolerances.
