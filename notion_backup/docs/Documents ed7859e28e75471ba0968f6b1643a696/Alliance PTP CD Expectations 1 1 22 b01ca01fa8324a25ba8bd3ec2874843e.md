> The Clinic Director is responsible for efficient clinical services, operations, clinic growth and staff development. The Clinic Director will maximize growth by providing uncompromised therapy services and consistently initiating direct marketing to sustain and develop referral sources. Success will be measured not only by meeting revenue, profit, growth and compliance goals, but also by relationships built with staff, patients, and referral sources, as well as the clinical training and development of staff.

- At times, more than 40 hours of patient care may be necessary (PTO coverage, staff calls in sick, etc). CD sets the tone in terms of flexibility. If CD is unwilling to stay late, come in early, shift patients, other team members will be reluctant to do the same. Set the example.
