> This report will provide you with all of the visits your patients have scheduled and/or attended. From this report you can determine who is going to need more visits, & who isn’t following their prescribed treatment and who is MIA. It is a great tool to use when you have a therapist on vacation, you can look the dates they are gone and determine if there are keeping up with their treatment plans.

1. You will need to access reports through your desktop shortcut.
