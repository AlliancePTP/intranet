# Work Queue/Case Files

# Work Queue Overview:

> The work flow of Agile documentation is managed through tasks listed in Work Queues for each user type. Users can access tasks in the Work Queue in two ways:
> 
1. **Global Work Queue**: Click **Work Queue** on the menu bar. All the user's tasks for any applicable patients will be listed here. ***Note:** the number to the left of Work Queue indicates how many tasks the user has in the queue.*
    
    ![Work%20Queue%20Case%20Files%20d113313244444dd9b7dc6e8874eb6530/image80.jpeg](Work%20Queue%20Case%20Files%20d113313244444dd9b7dc6e8874eb6530/image80.jpeg)
    
2. **Case Work Queue:** In the patient's Home Case page, click the Documentation tab. Tasks related to that specific patient's case will be listed.

3. View an authorization which is required and/or expiring soon
4. Contact an active patient who has not been seen for a certain amount of days, and does not have any more scheduled appointments (Case Inactivity Alert)
