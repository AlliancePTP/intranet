# Patient Intake/Cases

# New Patient Intake:

> Always use the New Patient Intake Form as a guide, copies can be found on the Intranet site.
> 
> 
> When scheduling new patients there needs to be a sense of urgency. Many of our patients are in pain and should not have to wait. If you approach the patient this way, they are much more likely to get in and get the help they need. Sometimes just the way you word things makes all the difference in the world on how quickly they will schedule.
> 
> If the doctor’s office is calling, please ask if the patient is standing right there with them. If they are, go ahead and schedule them. If they are not, obtain the patient name, doctor’s name, diagnosis, insurance, and phone number. Let the doctor’s office know we will contact the patient ourselves to get the best
> 
> time for the patient. You can let the doctor’s office know we will contact them once the patient has scheduled their appointment. When you receive a referral by fax or phone, you need to make an immediate attempt to contact the patient to schedule an appointment that day. If you cannot contact the patient at the first phone number, try their cell or work phone the next time you call. Do NOT
> 
> disclose anything about the patient’s injury.
> 
> When you leave a message please say “This is   from (Clinic Name) Physical Therapy (location). Dr.   asked us to schedule you for physical therapy as soon as possible. The sooner you call us back the quicker we can start to help you. Please call us back today (date) at (phone number) to schedule an appointment.”
> 
> Write on the referral document: when you called, what happened, and any other important information. Call again within 24 hours and at different time of day. If there is no response in 24 hours, call once more. Give another 24 hours to respond and then reach out to the MD asking for another method of contact as you have been unable to reach the patient to schedule them for physical therapy.
> 
> Patients may also call or walk in to schedule an appointment. It is our policy that we schedule the patient as soon as possible (within 0-48 hours).
> 
> If you are unaware if we take a certain insurance, please gather all the insurance information, inform the patient we will do a courtesy verification of their benefits and encourage them to do the same. This will alleviate any discrepancies and ensure the patient too understands their benefits. Please let the patient know as soon as possible if we are not in their network with their insurance. You can also obtain the out of network benefits and let the patient know those as well. That could always be an option.
> 
> We welcome patients who do not have insurance or wish to not use their individual health insurance by offering them a Self-Pay rate (check with your Clinic Director on the cost as these may vary by state). It is important to tell the patient when scheduling how much it will cost them per visit. With Self-Pay, it is required that the patient pays that rate at the Time of Service.
> 
> Use the Patient Intake Form as a guide; fill it out as you go. This is all the initial information we need. If the patient is a minor, they MUST have a parent or guardian physically with the minor and present for the ENTIRE first visit. This is to ensure that both the patient and parent/guardian are aware of AND agree to the treatment plan, financial plan, consent to treat, and Cancellation policy.
> 
> After the initial information is received look in Agile RPM schedule for the NEXT available one-hour Eval slot with a Physical Therapist. Ask the patient for their email address, explaining they will receive a Welcome Letter from us which will include a link to their paperwork that you need them to fill out in its
> 
> entirety and bring to their initial appointment. If the patient does not have or refuses to provide an email, refer the patient to our website to obtain the paperwork there. If the patient does not have access or is unable to obtain paperwork prior to their first appointment, ask the patient to arrive 30 minutes prior to their scheduled appt time to complete the paperwork in its entirety as well as to bring their insurance cards & photo ID with them as well as a calendar as you will be scheduling their follow up appointments after their evaluation. This is to allow for paperwork time and to take the appropriate copies of their insurance cards. Ask the patient if they know where our office is located and if needed, provide directions. Make sure to give the address and phone number of the clinic they are scheduled in so there is no confusion. Also, be sure to tell the patient who they will be seeing.
> 
> Additionally, if the patient has Medicare or Medicare Advantage type insurance, please ask them to bring a current list of their medications, vitamins, and supplements including the dosage and frequency.
> 
> Next, schedule the patient in Agile for their evaluation, make sure you are using the appropriated Initial Evaluation appointment type. If the patient is a past patient of ours, please use their old account to make a new case. Then write a Clinical Note that includes the diagnosis, insurance, referring doctor, and any additional information that may be handy for the PT to know ahead of time.
>

> It is the job of the Front Office Coordinator to schedule all patients both new and current treating patients. You are also responsible for asking patients “when is your next appointment?” not “do you know when your next appointment is?” This reminds the patients of their upcoming appointments and when the patient has their last appointment in the schedule.
> 

### New Patients:

1. When the patient is finished with the therapist you will need to schedule the patient according to the clinician’s recommendation.
2. Review the Cancellation policy with the patient, asking them to provide a 24-hour notice if/when possible in order to reschedule that visit and allow us to fill it with another patient should they not be able to make that originally scheduled visit. If we are not provided a notice, they could be subjected to a Cancellation fee.
3. Review the verification of the patient’s benefits (prior to their Initial Evaluation) with them, informing of any $ due, determine how they will pay, and document it. Not a bad idea to review at conclusion of appt as well to ensure the patient understands and your encouragement to the patient to verify their benefits as well.
4. Schedule the patient according to the Clinician’s prescribed treatment plan, full duration.
5. If the patient is PTA appropriate try to schedule visits equally with the PTA to help them maintain a full schedule and leave openings for new evaluations on the PT schedule.
    1. Please note 9th and 10th visits should always be scheduled with a PT for reporting purposes.
    2. Be aware of authorized visits when scheduling as well so that we can be sure the patient is on the PTs schedule when auth is needed.

> For the first follow up visit:
> 
1. Click on available slot and schedule as you would a NP
2. Select the correct visit type
3. Enter patient’s last name in box
4. Select the correct patient from the list and click Add Appointment

> For the all remaining follow up visits:
> 
1. Once the appointment is on the schedule you can clone it to make scheduling faster
2. Click on the first follow up appointment
3. Click Clone in the upper right corner of the pop-up
4. Select the number of visits you would like to have available to put on the schedule
    1. I recommend choosing 7 or the remaining number of authorized visits (to get you to the progress note) as these will show up as the same appointment type as the “cloned” appointment
    2. Or the remaining number of visits needed to complete the RxTx – if you choose this option you will need to edit the appointment type for the progress note date
    3. This will create a pool of visits to pull from at the bottom of the screen
5. Go to the next date available for the patient and drag and drop the appointment in the correct slot
6. Continue for all remaining appointments
7. Print their schedule
    1. Go back to the current day **Note: the schedule will only print the appointments following the date of the appointment that you selected to print from
    2. Click on the appointment
    3. Click on Schedule at the top right of the pop-up – this opens a window with their full schedule
    4. Print from this screen

> If you are scheduling the patient with a clinician other than the evaluating clinician, explain that we use a team approach and all clinicians work together and review all treatment plans. If the patient wants to see only one person – be sure to inform the Clinic Director as he/she will advise.
> 
> 
> If the patient only insists on scheduling one week at a time or something other than the prescribed treatment do your best to discourage this. Explain that while we can change the appointment days during the week to accommodate them; we anticipate seeing them 2-3x/week. Scheduling them out allows us to plan for staffing as well as provides them the times they ideally prefer as the schedule fills quickly. Let them know that we would like to schedule them out for the full treatment plan and we can always remove them if there is a conflict.
> 
> Inform the patient if one of these appointments’ conflicts with another appointment or work; please
> 
> have them call as soon as possible to change this appointment, as our schedule does fill up fast.
> 
> At this time explain their health insurance benefits if this has not been done, then collect the copay or financial responsibility for that visit.
> 

### Current Treating Patients:

1. When checking in patients verify with the schedule if this is their last scheduled appointment.
    1. If so, please inform the therapist and ask how many more sessions will be needed or if there are plans for DC.
2. If no more appointments are scheduled, schedule according to the therapist how many more sessions per week will be needed.
3. Document any change to the Prescribed Treatment in the account notes

# Cloning an appointment:

> Cloning an appointment should be used when you are scheduling out multiple appointments for a patient.
> 
1. Select the appointment from the schedule.
