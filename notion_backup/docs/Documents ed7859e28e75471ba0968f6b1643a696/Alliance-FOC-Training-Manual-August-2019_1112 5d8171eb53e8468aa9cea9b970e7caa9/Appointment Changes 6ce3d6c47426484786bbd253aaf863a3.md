> Maintaining a Full Schedule:
> 
> 
> It is the responsibility of the Front Office Coordinator to make sure the schedule is full and that all patients are scheduled for their full treatment plan. Our goal is to get the patient better as soon as possible; this means getting them scheduled for their IE as soon as possible (within 48 hours), scheduling them for their FULL treatment plan, and limiting Cancellations or missed appointments. If the patient
> 
> isn’t here, we can’t help them. When patients fall off the schedule the patient doesn’t get better; they never say it is not because they were non-compliant; it is because PT just doesn’t work and that is the word of mouth they spread (BAD NEWS). Therefore, we need to make sure they are getting the best treatment possible which means keeping them on task.

### Helpful Tips for Keeping the Schedule Full:

1. Look at your schedule first thing Monday morning to figure out where you can put new patients (NP) in the schedule. Recheck this every morning first thing.
2. Create a sense of urgency to get the patient to schedule as soon as possible. If a NP comes in on M – Th we can get another visit or two for them in that same week.
3. Offer next available appointment first. If they call on Monday and you have an opening Monday afternoon, try to get them in there. This leaves other slots open for NPs who call later in the week.
4. Do NOT ask them when they want to come in. Offer them times that allow hour slots for NP to stay open. Example: If the schedule is full at the 9:00 and 11:00 slots but open between them, don’t put a follow up at 10:00. Put them at 9:30 or 10:30 to keep an hour NP slot there.
5. Saying, “I just had an appointment open up today 3:00pm. Let’s get you in there.” This leaves

> less choice and keeps the sense of urgency.
> 
1. Do NOT say, “When do you want to come in? The schedule is wide open”. (This suggests there

> is no urgency and we are not busy).
> 
1. Get the patient to schedule all appointments on the prescribed treatment on the first day. We can make changes if necessary but it is best to get them in right away.
2. When checking out the NP after their IE, the clinician will have reviewed their treatment plan with them and walk them up to the Front Desk to confirm with the patient the agreed upon frequency and inform the FOC for scheduling purposes. Ask the patient their preferred time of day they would ideally like their appts scheduled (Morning or Afternoon), schedule the patient for their next visit, confirm they can make it and let the patient go. Explain that you will put together a schedule for them based off this information and have it ready at their next visit for you to review together.
