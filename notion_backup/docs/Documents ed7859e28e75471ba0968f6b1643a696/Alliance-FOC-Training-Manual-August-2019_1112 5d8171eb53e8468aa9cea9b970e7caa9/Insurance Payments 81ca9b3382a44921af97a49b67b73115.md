# Financial Policy:

> Financial Arrangements will be made with each patient (as required) for their specific treatment. The Front Office Coordinator will be discussing benefits and payment arrangements with all patients on their first date of service. ALL payment arrangements must be approved by the Revenue Cycle Supervisor. Our goal is to service the patient's individual needs to the best of our ability, enabling him/her to have the care wanted and required, without placing financial stress on the patient or the company.
> 
> 
> Unless specific arrangements are made in advance, all patients are expected to pay the co-pays, co- insurances, etc. at the time of service. It is often convenient to take the co-pay when the patient arrives (as long as they are not late). Some patients even like to pay their co-pays for the week on their first visit of the week. This can help with % arrival as patients who have paid ahead for a visit tend to arrive for that visit. Adult patients are responsible for payment, and the adult accompanying a minor is responsible for payment. If a child will not be accompanied by their parent each visit, please ask to send the copay with the child and/or call in the payment to the FOC. We accept cash, check, money order, or credit card as well as Care Credit.
> 
> For those patients covered by insurance, explain to the patient that we (FOC) will keep the patient informed of when their insurance pays on their claims and when their insurance drops a balance as the patient’s responsibility. When a balance falls to a patient, we (FOC) will ask for payment. If the patient pays anything but the total amount due, the FOC will accept it and document in the Notes section of the Home page within the patient’s chart, in Agile, what the agreed upon payment plan is and follow up regularly with the patient to continue collecting the balance.
> 

# Taking Current Patient Payments:

> It is the responsibility of the Front Office Coordinator to collect all financial responsibility and co-pays from each patient according to the Clinic Daily Overview Report as they arrive or leave the clinic. Each patient has signed off on the financial policy as well as the Insurance Verification Form that they are responsible for payment each time they come to treatment, unless specific arrangements have been made. As mentioned above we take cash, check, and all major credit cards as well as Care Credit.
