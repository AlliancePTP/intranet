# How do I log in?

Visit [https://wp.myprintdesk.net/DSF/storefront.aspx#!/Storefront](https://wp.myprintdesk.net/DSF/storefront.aspx%23!/Storefront) to access the print e-store. Your username is your full email address (ie. First.Last@Practice.com) and your default password is aptp01. If you are still having issues, please contact [Marketing@AlliancePTP.com](mailto:Marketing@AlliancePTP.com) with your username and password you are trying, as well as any error codes that appear.

# Who has access to the e-store?

The leadership at each practice confirmed who should have order access for the e-store. Please refer to the practice leader(s) for reference of who was added as a user. It was recommended that each location’s Front Office Coordinator and Clinic Director have access to order, as well as any business development or operational team members.

# How do I change who has access to the e-store?

Please email [Marketing@AlliancePTP.com](mailto:Marketing@AlliancePTP.com) with any user changes. If a new user needs to be added, please provide their first and last name, email address, title, and location.

# My personal information is not correct, how do I change it?

Once logged in to the e-store, you can edit your profile and information by clicking on your name in the top right corner and selecting *My Profile*. Once on the My Profile page, an *Edit Profile* button will appear at the top right corner of the box. Click save once all edits are complete to save changes. Please ensure you do not adjust the Custom Field options.

# A piece needs to be updated or has changes, what do I do?

If an item needs changes, please fill out a marketing support intake form and submit it to [Marketing@AlliancePTP.com](mailto:Marketing@AlliancePTP.com).

# I need to order materials, but I can’t find them on my e-store, what do I do?

If you need to order print materials that are not available on your e-store, please fill out a marketing support intake form and submit it to [Marketing@AlliancePTP.com](mailto:Marketing@AlliancePTP.com).

# How do I see a larger preview of what I am ordering?

To view a large scale, high quality preview of an item, click on the image. An information and details box will pop up with more details of the item. A preview link will be available at the top of the information box. Select *Preview* and a new window will open with the preview. Simply close out of the window and you will return to your shopping experience where you left off.

# Can I order multiple items at once?

Yes! Once an item is added to your cart, you can continue shopping and adding items to your cart.

# How do I check out?

Once all items are added to your cart for the order, click on the shopping cart icon at the top right and select CheckOut. Please review all items in your cart and their quantities and select *Proceed to Checkout*. In the first checkout screen, you will need to confirm the shipping address. If the default address is not correct, click the drop down menu at the top to select the appropriate address or to add a new shipping address. Once the shipping address is accurate, click the *Proceed to Payment* button at the bottom right. To submit the order, click *Place My Order* at the bottom right.

# How is payment processed?

Payment is processed and allocated by our team at corporate. You do not need to enter any payment information.

# I placed my order, what now?

Once the order is placed, the approver for the brand will need to approve the order. In most cases, this is the practice leader. An approval email automatically sends to the approver when an order is placed. If the order has not been approved, the person who placed the order can send a reminder approval message through the e-store.

# How long will it be until I recieve my order?

The order will ship to the address indicated on the order. Estimated timelines for print production are included on each item in the e-store in the information and details box. To view this, simply click on the image of the item and the information box will open. Shipping takes roughly 2-3 days once the order is completed.
