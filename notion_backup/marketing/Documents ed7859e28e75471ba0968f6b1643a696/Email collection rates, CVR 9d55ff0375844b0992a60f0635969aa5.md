**Did you know?**

Collecting email addresses impacts your business further than just being in “best practice.” Patient email addresses are a major contribution to successful marketing, building loyalty and credibility, streamlined operations, assisting with drop-off prevention, and is also a direct source of revenue.

**Tell me how**

Marketing uses collected email addresses for both automated course of care email communications via WebPT Reach and monthly “lead nurturing*” newsletters via Constant Contact.

> *Lead nurturing = developing and reinforcing relationships with patients
> 

During this email journey, patients are

- Delivered paperwork to streamline their intake process (operations)
- Prompted to submit NPS and Google Review surveys (loyalty, credibility)
- Presented with exclusive content within the standard course of care drop-off window (drop-off prevention)
- Delivered ample opportunities to request an appointment or free screening (loyalty, revenue)

**You mentioned revenue source…**

In a recent analysis of marketing-related conversions*, on weeks where the monthly newsletter is delivered to patients, conversions increase by an average of +16%, which is equivalent to an +$27,000 in one week – just from collecting email addresses.

> *Conversions = the point at which a recipient of a marketing message performs a desired action. In our case, patient requests an appointment or free screening.
> 

**But wiat, there’s more (sic)**

Across all partners, the current average email collection rate is **79%**. But just because an email address is *collected* doesn’t mean it’s *correct.* Our average bounce rate* is **11%**, meaning marketing emails can only reach ~**68%** of the patients seen. (I say about because a portion of those bounces are due to other variables out of our control that make a patient unreachable).

> *Bounce rate = Emails sent, but can’t be delivered
> 

Now, you can’t force patients to give us their personal information. Or stop a patient from giving us a fake email address because they don’t want to be contacted. Truthfully, that’s just fine – they’re not likely to convert anyway. What you can help is reducing typos to lower the bounce rate and increase possible conversions. You can also help by educating the patient on what their email address is used for and how often to expect to hear from you.

Common errors we see (and do our best to catch) is:

- Duplicate letters ([jane@gmaill.com](mailto:jane@gmaill.com))
- Missing letters ([john@yaho.com](mailto:john@yaho.com))
- Mixed-up letters ([jane@gmial.com](mailto:jane@gmial.com))

Informing patient of email address use:

- Receive exclusive educational content on their specific Dx
- Opportunity to leave feedback/reviews so more people can find [BRAND] in the community
- Monthly video content inspired to prevent and reduce common aches and pains
- They can opt-out at any time

Marketing has set up an automated email journey for patients designed to deliver patient paperwork, encourage NPS/Google Reviews, offer free screenings and deliver exclusive educational content. Another way to make email marketing a more enjoyable experience for patients is to trust the automated emails that are in place and limit the amount you are personally sending to patients outside of this.

**Moral of the story**

Imagine the possibilities if **every** patient’s email address is recorded **every** time and **error-free**.
