# Marketing Events and Sponsorships

There can be many benefits to strategically sponsoring marketing and branding opportunities within local markets. It should be noted that marketing opportunities should not be the only solution to building improved brand awareness and patient/referral volumes.

### **Things to look for when recommending a marketing investment*:**

1. **Relevance**‚Äîthe cause must be relevant to your brand‚Äôs products or service. Branding Fit‚Äîthere must be a good fit with the overall company brand.
    1. *Examples of good branding fits: sports teams, local foot/cycling races, science-backed nutritional supplements*
    2. *Examples of bad branding fits: faith-based organizations, chiropractic work, McDonald‚Äôs*
2. **Mission Alignment**‚Äîthe partnership must align with the overall company's mission.
3. **Business Result**‚Äîthe company must believe it can achieve some measurable business result through the partnership.

**More tactically, this looks like:**

- Direct, face-to-face time with a captive audience (either referral sources or potential patients)
    - i.e. Setting up a booth for free mobility screenings prior to a community 5k
- Exclusive branding opportunity that positions you better/more frequently than the competition
    - A long-term sponsorship that will span several months/years
