# WHAT IS A WORK CONDITIONING/HARDENING PROGRAM?

An intensive physical conditioning program that focuses on key components of cardiovascular fitness,
flexibility and strength, as well as work simulated activities to promote a safe return to work.

# WHO IS IT FOR?

Any patient that is unable to return to full-duty secondary to functional limitations can benefit from a
work conditioning program. Ideal for injured workers who are not working or are working part-time
light duty.

# WHAT IS THE LENGTH OF THE PROGRAM?

Programs are typically 4 - 5 hours per day, 3-5 days a week for approximately a 4 week time frame unless
otherwise specified by the Attending Physician. This program is tailored to the needs of the patient and
the job demands they will return to.

# WHAT WILL THE PROGRAM INCLUDE?

A typical day will include aerobic activity to promote cardiovascular training, stamina, circulation to help
with healing and stress-management. Stretching and mobility activities are included to address range of
motion limitations and to minimize stress on non-injured body parts during conditioning. Modalities
and manual therapy will be provided as needed. Strengthening and/or stabilization exercises are
tailored towards the specific injury.

The program also will incorporate functional work-simulated activities to aid in return to work. A session
is designed specifically for a worker based on their job goals and requirements. We also work to provide
all patients with the tools necessary to manage any potential flare-ups, should they occur, and to
continue with a physical conditioning plan upon completion of the program.

# WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THE PATIENT?

To be punctual and consistent with attendance, dressed in proper clothing/footwear for exercise and
movement. Participants must be willing and motivated to participate-patients get out of the program
what they put into it. Open communication with our team and the therapist is encouraged.

# WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS?

- Plan to return to work/job description provided to therapist
- Referral from Attending Physician
- Authorization from Insurance Payer to participate

# COMMUNICATION

- A team approach-The injured worker and therapist communicating on progress and/or any
adjustments to the program.
- Case Manager/Employer provided timely progress updates under the direction of the Attending
Physician.
