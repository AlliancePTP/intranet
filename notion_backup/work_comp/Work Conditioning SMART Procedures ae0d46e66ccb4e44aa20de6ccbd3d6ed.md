1. **New acct. set up.** ***VISIT TYPE=WORK CONDITIONING***. Need referral from Attending Physician specifically for
Work conditioning, no less than 3x/wk. Need to call and correct if referral says anything else.
2. **Authorization:** Should have auth verified **before** first visit, # of visits can vary, but 10-20 is reasonable.
3. **Daily Treatment Routine:** ***Patient is in the clinic for 3-5 hours, EVEN ON 1ST DAY. There are exceptions to thisper case. Sometimes there is a slow build to tolerance, but no less than 2 hrs. ever.***
4. **Scheduling:** Patient scheduled ASAP **for minimal 2 hour session, even first visit**. This works best when program
is planned approximately 2 wks prior to DC from acute PT. Patient will be placed on one therapist schedule daily
& overlap w/ other patients as WCond is not 1:1 required & program geared toward more independence.
5. **WC VISIT 1** : ***No Eval code-*** 1:1 time to orient to program, baseline testing for lifts, positional tolerances, provide
program structure, demo all exercises/activity for safe and efficient form.
6. **Billing codes** : **Codes 97545 (first 2 hours) and 97546** (any time after 2 hours) **ONLY**. **No eval code is used.**
7. **Daily sessions:** Patient should be set up each day with activity sheet. Can work with PT, PTA, tech and be
somewhat independent. Clinician having visual on patient during session. Pt. will record sets/reps and time
with activities, checking in with therapist as directed.
8. **Work Cond/SMART Duration** : **3 - 5X/week 2 - 5 hr session daily** for approx. 4 - 6 weeks. Will depend on MD
referral, patient work status and condition of patient. Generally, if patient is not working, preference is 5X/wk 3 -
5 hour per visit for max benefit.
9. **Attendance/Participation:** Crucial to success of program. Should be educated at visit 1 and patient + clinician
initial the WC/SMART Dedication page.
10. **JA or Job Analysis/Description** : ALL WC patients should have a JA on file-FOC requesting when receive
referral/authorization ideally prior to first session. Can use DOT [[http://www.occupationalinfo.org](http://www.occupationalinfo.org/).]([http://www.occupationalinfo.org](http://www.occupationalinfo.org/).) Record the job
code into Eval subjective area and note PDL level.
11. **Goals and PDL:** Return to work specific goals related to physical demand level with designated job description.
Functional tolerances in clinic progressing toward PDL level.
12. **Therapeutic Exercise/Activity/Material Wt. Handling (work sim) :** Refer to Daily exercise/activity sheet,
focusing on primary deficits **(strength, stamina, repetitive motion, mechanics, positional tolerances).**
Progressive approach w/ varied exercise/activity/lifts for whole body complete with circuits, cardio, core ex. and
stretching/cooldown.
13. **Documentation:** Utilize pre-set WC activity sheets for daily tasks and scan into Agile every 3-5 days. Record
effort (BP can be taken), tolerance and return to work progress in Agile daily note.
14. **Progress Notes/DC:** PN approximately ½ way through program or before if patient has MD follow-up.
Document objective measurable progress toward PDL and established RTW goals.
15. **Communication:** Should be contacting case mgr. Documenting any conversations concerning care with
Adjuster, MD, CM, Attorney, Vocational, etc. in Home tab/Clinical Notes.
16. **HEP:** Established to allow the worker to progress and/or maintain function, manage flare-ups after discharge.
17. **Exceptional Customer Service:** Friendly and encouraging! Make the program functional but fun and safe.
