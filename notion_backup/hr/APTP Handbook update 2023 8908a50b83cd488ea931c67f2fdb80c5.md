# INTRODUCTION

## HISTORY

Founded in 2017, Grand Rapids, MI-based Alliance Physical Therapy Group, LLC, d/b/a Alliance Physical Therapy Partners is currently the 7th largest owner and operator of outpatient rehabilitation clinics.

Alliance, a portfolio company of BPOC, was created to partner with excellent outpatient physical therapy clinics across the U.S. Alliance invests in clinics in which the owner wishes to participate in the future growth of their clinic and gain the support of a centralized team of business experts to aid with the development of their clinics and local market share.

Alliance achieved rapid growth through partnering, becoming one of the largest physical therapy providers in the U.S. in under a year. Alliance has partnered with clinic groups ranging from 1 – 50+ outpatient clinics in size, including the acquisition of the U.S. operations of Agility Health in February 2018.

Alliance operates outpatient and onsite physical therapy clinics, provides contract rehabilitation services industrial worksites and fabricates custom orthotic solutions.

## THIS HANDBOOK

This employee handbook is effective January 1, 2023, and supersedes all previous handbooks. The policies and procedures discussed in this handbook apply to all employees of Alliance Physical Therapy Group, LLC, its subsidiaries and related or managed companies.

For clarity and ease of understanding, throughout this handbook we will refer to the employer as “Alliance”.

Although this handbook summarizes many important items regarding your employment with Alliance, there may be more detailed information contained in policies, procedures, or other documents. In the event of a conflict between information contained in this handbook and more detailed documents, the more detailed documents should be followed. Your specific work location may have policies, practices, and procedures specific to that site’s operational needs that go beyond what is described in this handbook. Please talk with your manager for further details.

Alliance reserves the sole right in its business judgment to modify, suspend, interpret, or cancel all or part of these published policies, practices, processes or benefits. When changes occur, Alliance will endeavor to provide employees with notification of those changes. Posting a revised version of the handbook on the company website will constitute sufficient notice of any change.

This handbook is written broadly and flexibly because we cannot cover every practical or legal contingency, and so we offer general guidance on the main features of our employment policies and benefits. Every provision in this Handbook is intended for business application (whether or not we have identified specific business reasons or examples), and no provision should ever be read to interfere with – and will not deter you from – the exercise of your legal rights as protected by state or federal law. To the extent any provision of this agreement is read or potentially could be read to violate any such right, Alliance will apply any such policy in a way that does not violate that right.

As you begin your employment with Alliance, we request that you read this employee handbook. You will be asked to sign an acknowledgment and indicate that you have received this handbook and you will abide by its policies and procedures.

Because this employee handbook is being distributed to employees in multiple states and cities, in some areas local laws may be in effect and are not necessarily mentioned here. Alliance will fully comply with all applicable local laws and ordinances.

## AUTHORITY TO CONTRACT

No manager or representative of Alliance, other than the CEO has any authority to enter into any agreement for employment for any specific or indefinite period of time, or to make any agreement contrary to the terms of this handbook. Any such agreement must be made by the CEO and must be made in writing to be effective. No person within Alliance has the authority to modify this policy except the CEO.

## CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

As part of your work for Alliance, you may be given access to confidential information of Alliance or its clients that could harm the organization if it were disclosed to individuals outside of Alliance. Confidential information includes all information that Alliance owns or uses and includes, without limitation, its marketing, organizational or business plans, its computer programs, or business improvements, its sales and marketing forecasts, pricing and other nonpublic financial information that is not generally known to the public. In the event you have any question about whether information is confidential, you must treat the information as confidential until you obtain permission to disclose it from your manager.

You must keep confidential information confidential, both during your employment and after your separation, and only use the confidential information as required to perform your job duties. This means you should not disclose confidential information to coworkers who have no need to know about the information or to persons outside the workplace. Your duty to keep confidential information private lasts as long as the information remains confidential. Your duty to protect and not disclose confidential information exists while you are working for Alliance and also after your employment ends.

Alliance is required to keep all personal identifying information of all employees confidential. Personal identifying information includes social security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers, personal e-mail addresses, internet identification names or passwords, parent’s surname prior to marriage, or drivers’ license numbers. Specifically, employees must not publicly post or display an employee’s social security number, place a social security number in files with unrestricted access; or communicate an employee’s personal identifying information to the general public.

Employees must immediately report to the Compliance Department any violation of this policy. If a violation of this policy occurs, the Company will notify the affected employees in compliance with the applicable laws.

## REIMBURSEMENT

Upon termination of employment, you are responsible for returning any Alliance property in your possession and for paying any expenses or other amounts that you may owe to Alliance at that time, including any negative vacation balance. By signing this handbook, you authorize Alliance to deduct the amount(s) owed from any wage or benefit payments that may be due to you. You may choose not to agree to this paragraph and it will not have any bearing on your employment relationship with Alliance, provided however that you shall become ineligible to participate in Alliance’s negative PTO or vacation balance program.

# EMPLOYMENT ADMINISTRATION

## AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT

> All employees at Alliance are at-will employees unless the CEO has signed a written agreement stating otherwise. This means that either you or Alliance has the right to terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without notice, and with or without any reason. None of the policies or procedures you receive at Alliance change the right of employees and Alliance to end the employment relationship as described above.
> 

## EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

> Alliance maintains a policy of equal opportunity for all patients, employees, and candidates. Alliance is an Equal Opportunity Employer and does not discriminate on the basis of actual or perceived race, religion, creed, color, age, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, ancestry, marital status, medical condition, military and veteran status,
> 
> 
> pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state, or local laws and ordinances with respect to recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, transfer, training, compensation, benefits, employee activities, and general treatment during employment. Alliance is dedicated to fostering an environment that respects the dignity, rights, and contributions of its employees, patients, and candidates.
> 
> All employees are responsible for ensuring that the workplace is free from unlawful discrimination. If an employee believes that he or she has been subjected to or witnessed any discrimination, he or she must contact the Vice President of Human Resources. All complaints of discrimination will be investigated thoroughly and promptly. Anyone found to have violated this Equal Employment Opportunity policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Alliance will not tolerate retaliation against any employee for making a complaint of unlawful discrimination.
> 

## EMPLOYEE DIGNITY

> Alliance expects all employees to conduct themselves with dignity and with respect for fellow employees and others. Harassing or discriminating against anyone, including sexual or racial harassment, will not be tolerated. Harassment is any severe and pervasive unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical, or visual, that is based on sex, race, color, national origin, age, religion, disability or any other legally protected characteristic.
> 
> 
> Alliance does not condone or allow harassment or discrimination of others, whether engaged in by fellow employees, supervisors, managers,
> 
> patients, vendors, or others doing business with the Company.
> 
> All discrimination, harassment, and retaliation is unacceptable in the workplace and in any work- related settings such as business trips and business-related social functions, regardless of whether the conduct is engaged in by a supervisor, co-worker, client, customer, vendor, or other third party.
> 
> Any employee who violates this policy may be subject to discipline up to and including discharge.
> 
> Harassment includes:
> 
1. Sexual Harassment includes making submission to unwelcome sexual advances, submission to requests for sexual favors, or submission to other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, a condition of any person’s continued employment or association with Alliance, or making submission to, or rejection of, such conduct the basis for employment decisions affecting any person.
2. Hostile Environment Harassment includes unwelcome verbal, visual, or physical conduct creating an intimidating, offensive, or hostile work environment that interferes with work performance. Harassment can be verbal (including slurs, jokes, insults, epithets, gestures, or teasing), graphic (including offensive posters, symbols, cartoons, drawings, computer displays, or emails) or physical conduct (including physically threatening another, blocking someone’s way, etc.) that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion towards an individual because of any protected characteristic.

> Any employee who becomes aware of discrimination or harassment in violation of the policies stated above must immediately report the matter to his or her manager and to Human Resources. You can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal or retaliation.
> 
> 
> All allegations of sexual or other types of harassment will be quickly and discreetly investigated. Employees are expected to cooperate in this process if asked to do so, and to provide truthful information. To the extent possible, your confidentiality and that of any witnesses and the alleged harasser will be protected against unnecessary disclosure. However, that cannot be guaranteed.
> 
> If Alliance determines that an employee has violated this policy, prompt and appropriate remedial action will be taken in accordance with the circumstances, up to and including immediate termination of the individual found to have violated the policy.
> 

### Anti-Retaliation

> Alliance will not retaliate against any person for making a good faith complaint under this policy, or any person who, during the investigation, provided truthful information (other than someone who has been found to violate this policy). An employee who retaliates against another employee for making a complaint in good faith will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination.
> 

## QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES

> In its consideration of employees and applicants for employment, Alliance will focus on qualifications, abilities, and aptitude to perform job tasks as required by the job.
> 
> 
> Alliance is committed to diversity in employment and to equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities. We fully comply with the ADA and state and local laws protecting qualified individuals with disabilities against discrimination in employment. We also provide reasonable accommodations for such individuals in accordance with these laws.
> 
> If an employee believes that accommodation of a disability is necessary to perform the essential functions of a position, he or she must notify Human Resources as soon as the employee knows of the need for an accommodation. Alliance will obtain and review relevant medical and job information, work closely with the requesting employee to identify and evaluate possible accommodations, and ensure appropriate confidentiality in the process. Alliance will evaluate each request based on the circumstances of that particular situation. The accommodation process is interactive, and employee participation and cooperation are extremely important.
> 
> In accordance with state and federal law, we may not always provide the specific accommodation requested by an employee if an alternate reasonable accommodation is available and effective. We may also decline to make an accommodation where it would be unreasonable, would present a direct threat to health or safety, or where it would impose an undue hardship on Alliance or other employees.
> 

## EMPLOYEE SCREENING

> Alliance believes that hiring and maintaining well qualified employees contributes to the overall success of the organization. The safety of our patients and employees is also paramount. To this end, Alliance may conduct a background check in connection with an individual’s current or potential employment. Alliance may use a third party to conduct the background checks
> 
> 
> and obtain a background investigation report, which is called a “consumer report” under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The type of information that can be collected in a background check includes, but is not limited to, information pertaining to an individual’s past employment, education, finances, driving record, and criminal record.
> 
> If Alliance considers taking an adverse employment decision based on the information obtained through a background check, it will inform the individual of the information so they can review the background report. A prior conviction does not necessarily make an individual ineligible for employment, promotion, or retention. Alliance will consider the nature and gravity of the offense, the time that has lapsed since the conviction, any evidence of rehabilitation, and the nature of the job sought in making employment decisions.
> 
> All information obtained from any reference or background checks will be kept as confidential as possible.
> 

## EMPLOYMENT APPLICATION

> Alliance relies upon the accuracy of information contained in your employment application, as well as the accuracy of other data presented throughout the hiring process or obtained during employment. Any misrepresentations, falsifications, or material omissions in any of this information or data may result in disqualification from further consideration for employment or, if you have been hired, termination of employment.
> 

## DISCLOSURE OF CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS

> An employee must notify his/her manager no later than three (3) business days after a criminal
> 
> 
> conviction, unless this requirement is prohibited by law in the state in which the employee works. A ‘criminal conviction’ includes pleas of guilty or no contest, regardless of the resulting sentence or punishment. Under no circumstances should an employee report to work prior to giving Alliance notice of a criminal conviction. Failure to provide proper notice under this provision will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
> 

## EMPLOYEE RECORDS

> Confidential employment records are maintained by Human Resources for each Alliance employee. An employee record includes a number of employment documents including, but not limited to your employment application, position changes, performance evaluations, compensation history, corrective action, and other related items.
> 
> 
> Your employment record should always contain current information. It is your responsibility to notify Human Resources of any changes in your name, address, telephone numbers, number of dependents, emergency contacts, and educational accomplishments. It is important that this information be accurate. If Alliance does not have accurate information, you may experience a delay in receiving important materials such as documents you need to file a tax return or information relating to health insurance benefits.
> 

## LICENSURE AND CERTIFICATION

> As healthcare professionals, there are many positions that require licensure, certification, or testing requirements. Human Resources and/or your manager will inform you if there are these types of requirements for your position.
> 
> 
> If you work in a position requiring licensure, certification, and/or registration, you are required to have a valid and current license, certification, and/or registration for each state in which you work at the time of employment and at all times thereafter while employed by Alliance.
> 
> Licensure and certifications will be verified before hire and monitored throughout an individual’s employment with Alliance.
> 
> It is your responsibility to obtain and maintain a valid and current license, certification, and/or registration, and for promptly presenting the proper documents to your manager prior to any expiration dates. The cost of the license, certification, and/or registration is your responsibility.
> 
> An employee must notify his or her manager immediately in the event the employee’s license, certification, and/or registration is not renewed, is suspended, revoked, placed on probationary status, or placed under investigation. An employee who does not have a valid license, certification, and/or registration by the expiration date will not be permitted to work and may be terminated from employment.
> 

## DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES

> Alliance encourages each employee to realize his or her full professional potential. Employees are encouraged to openly discuss career goals with their manager and discuss how Alliance can assist in achieving these goals. We want to exceed expectations by providing the highest quality patient care and achieve and surpass key performance indicators for every position.
> 
> 
> To achieve these goals, Alliance recognizes that a large ingredient is building the competence, skills, and confidence of our employees. 
> 
> When appropriate, Alliance strives to promote from within. Job postings may be posted internally, but it is not required, depending on the position. If you are interested in transferring to another position within Alliance, contact your manager or a member of the Recruiting Department. Alliance will make employment selection decisions based on a number of factors, including past performance, skill, and length of service. While Alliance believes in providing advancement opportunities for its employees, there are times when Alliance may select an external candidate over a current employee.
> 
> At Alliance, we believe that professional licensure is the responsibility of each clinician. Therefore, we do not reimburse employees for their professional licensure or certification. However, to encourage the participation and development of staff, we do reimburse up to 50% for a full-time clinician’s membership to state and national associations (e.g. APTA) and 25% for part-time clinicians. Reimbursements should be submitted to Accounts Payable with a receipt and must be approved by the employee’s manager.
> 

## REQUIRED REGULATORY TRAINING

> Alliance provides periodic required training such as Fraud, Waste, & Abuse; sexual harassment prevention; compliance; HIPAA and OSHA training through MedBridge. Employees are expected to complete training on a timely basis. Completion of assigned regulatory training is a condition of employment. Failure to complete the assigned training can result in disqualification of any wage changes or incentives, and in some cases, disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
> 

# POLICIES

## CORRECTIVE ACTION/RULES OF CONDUCT

> Having rules and policies help an organization work together and to assist in understanding expectations of each other and our managers. From time to time, there may be an infraction of the rules, policies and procedures, or substandard performance. In the event of such a situation, Alliance will provide corrective action to assist in improving the behavior or performance. Our philosophy is to do this in a progressive manner; however, this may not always be possible. Situations may arise when termination of employment will occur without prior corrective or disciplinary action. Also, those employees receiving disciplinary action may be disqualified for any incentives during this period of time.
> 
> 
> Corrective action is generally issued in the form of a verbal warning, written warning, final written warning, then termination. An employee may also be placed on an investigative suspension during which time an employee is removed from his/her work schedule so that Alliance can conduct an investigation. Alliance will determine the appropriate level of corrective action in each situation, depending on pertinent information including the severity of the offense, the employee’s previous work record and length of service, precedent, and any other aggravating or mitigating factors. The aforementioned disciplinary steps are not required prior to termination of employment, and Alliance may deviate from them at its own discretion.
> 

### Examples of Workplace Misconduct

> It is not possible to list all the forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable in the
> 
> 
> workplace. Generally, Alliance expects employees to exercise common sense and good judgment. Conduct that is dishonest, insubordinate, or illegal will not be tolerated.
> 
> The following list of prohibited conduct is not all- inclusive, but it includes examples of conduct that may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination, depending on the circumstances.
> 
- Intentional falsification of Company records or reports or knowingly giving false information for records or reports
- Theft or inappropriate removal or possession of Alliance property
- Deliberate misuse, destruction or abuse of Company property
- Excessive absenteeism or tardiness
- Disrespectful, disruptive, or otherwise unacceptable interactions with patients, clients, or coworkers
- Violation of the Code of Conduct
- Engaging in fighting or disorderly conduct or carrying out an act of violence or threatening an act of violence against any employee, visitor, or patient on Company property or anywhere on Company time
- Possession of firearms or any illegal weapon on Alliance premises or while conducting business for Alliance
- Insubordination or other disrespectful conduct
- Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information
- Working under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs or any violation of the substance abuse policy
- Violating Alliance’s policies regarding confidentiality of Company and patient records
- Continued failure to meet the Company’s performance expectations for your position
- Any determined ethical violation or conflict of interest
- Improper use of Company property including equipment and computers
- Making unauthorized public statements on behalf of the Company or carrying out business of the Company in a way that may harm Alliance’s reputation in any way
- Violation of the Equal Employment Opportunity or Employee Dignity policies

## EMPLOYEE CODE OF CONDUCT

> All employees are expected to meet Alliance’s high standard of professionalism in everything they do as Alliance employees. Common sense and the utmost professionalism should govern all contact and communications with patients, clients, co-workers, and others with whom you have contact while working with us.
> 
> 
> Our expectations of you, and the standard of care and behavior expected of you, may exceed what is otherwise required by law. That’s because we have the highest expectations of you, your conduct, and your performance. You represent Alliance, and everything you do is reflective of the company and its employees.
> 
> For more information, employees can contact
> 
> Alliance’s Corporate Compliance Officer.
> 

### Patient/Employee Professional Relationship

> Patients depend on Alliance rehabilitation employees to help see them through a traumatic time in their lives. This trust, combined with the tactile nature of the treatments provided, require that patients place a high degree of trust in the professionalism of their rehab employee.
> 
> 
> Because of the uniqueness of the treatment setting and the patient relationship, Alliance employees must bring the highest degree of professionalism in all their interactions and treatment with patients. At all times, all employees must observe patient communication and treatment procedures below in this section to minimize misunderstandings and to protect each employee and Alliance from unsubstantiated allegations.
> 

### Patient Communication

> Clear communication with each patient is the key to preventing misunderstandings regarding the rehabilitation process. Misunderstandings occur when an employee fails to clearly communicate with the patient regarding the course of therapy before the treatment begins, and during the course of treatment. This is especially true in situations where the patient might perceive the action of the rehabilitation employee to be inappropriately intrusive.
> 
- Use a "knock and enter" practice when entering the closed door of a treatment area occupied by a patient. Before opening a curtain to enter a treatment area occupied by a patient, always first verbally request permission from the patient before pulling

> open the curtain and entering the treatment area.
> 
- Communicate with the patient the scope of the planned evaluation and/or treatment. Thoroughly explain the test and measurements you will be using before beginning them.
- Communicate with the patient the planned treatment approach and the medical basis for it, particularly when a patient might perceive the treatment to be intrusive or not directly related to an area where a patient limitation exists. Obtain informed consent from the patient to proceed with an evaluation or treatment technique.
- Be sensitive to how your actions may be perceived by patients who are not familiar with the treatment process. Always communicate with the patient during the course of evaluation and treatment regarding what will happen next and why.
- Doors or curtains to treatment areas should remain open when a rehab employee is present and providing treatment, when it does not compromise patient privacy.
- If applicable, proper draping of the patient should be a routine part of treatment setup. A patient should be provided with an appropriate covering (e.g. gown) during the course of treatment while a rehab employee is present.
- All patient treatment should occur at the client facility with no patient treatment occurring in a private setting, except for designated clinical home health visits.
- Request and use a same-sex chaperone to be present to observe evaluation and

> treatment or request reassignment of the patient to a same sex rehab employee when you believe this step is necessary.
> 
- At the conclusion of each patient treatment session, ask the patient, “Do you have any questions or concerns with your treatment session today?”

### Inadvertent and Accidental Contact

> Common sense dictates what to do when an inadvertent or accidental contact of a patient occurs. Address the matter immediately with the patient. An apology should be offered and a statement made that the contact was unintended. The incident and patient’s reaction should be immediately documented on a risk management report and given to your manager. The incident will be reviewed, with follow up with the patient as may be appropriate, to remediate the matter.
> 

### Inappropriate Conduct by Patient

> In the event an employee is the recipient of inappropriate conduct (verbal or physical) by a patient, the employee should immediately notify his or her manager (or designee) of this situation and document the incident on a risk management report. The manager will be responsible for promptly investigating the matter and taking appropriate follow-up action in conjunction with an Alliance Human Resources Representative.
> 

### Workplace Relationships

> All Alliance employees must be mindful of the special concerns regarding dating. Under no circumstances shall an employee who is providing treatment have a dating relationship with a patient he or she is currently treating. Any romantic, sexual or intimate relationship
> 
> 
> between a treating employee and a patient is inherently exploitive and, therefore, is prohibited. The nature of the treatments provided, and the trust patients place with their rehab employee means that a truly consensual relationship is most likely not possible.
> 
> Co-worker dating has inherent difficulties, especially when one of the employees is subordinate to the other. What might be perceived as a consensual relationship by one employee may be perceived differently by the other, especially after the relationship has ended. Members of Alliance management are prohibited from being involved in dating relationships with subordinates. Co-worker dating relationships are discouraged. Any such relationships need to be addressed affirmatively with your manager to determine if changes in work relationships are appropriate.
> 
> Alliance encourages the referral of friends and relatives for employment consideration. However, applicants will not be hired, or employees placed, or allowed to remain in a direct supervisory capacity of a family member or any other individual with whom a significant personal relationship exists. Employees will not be placed where their performance, development, or productivity can be affected as a result of the relationship. Exceptions will be made only in very limited situations, such as where the availability of professional staff is limited.
> 
> Alliance reserves the right to take prompt action if an actual or potential conflict of interest arises concerning individuals who occupy positions at any level in the same line of authority that may affect employment decisions. This action could include employment or position change decisions where potential conflict of interest, business impropriety, or adverse employment relationships could result.
> 

### Treatment of Family and Staff

> It is Alliance’s position that clinicians generally should not treat themselves, members of their immediate families, or clinic staff at their location of employment. Professional objectivity may be compromised when an immediate family member or colleague is the patient. Personal feelings and emotion can interfere with a person’s professional medical judgment, and although it may not always be inappropriate to undertake self-treatment or treatment of immediate family members, it is Alliance’s policy to strongly discourage it. Treatment in these cases can only occur when approved by the Vice President of Operations or COO.
> 

## WORKPLACE VIOLENCE PREVENTION

> Alliance is committed to protecting the safety of its employees, visitors, and customers. To that end, Alliance will not tolerate physical confrontations, explicit or implicit threats to use violence, harassment or intimidation.
> 
> 
> Violent or threatening conduct will not be tolerated on Company property or where we conduct business. For purposes of this policy, a threat includes any verbal or physical harassment or abuse, any attempt at intimidating or instilling fear in others, menacing gestures, stalking or any other hostile, aggressive, injurious or destructive action undertaken for the purpose of domination or intimidation. Employees who violate this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
> 
> To the fullest extent permitted by law, employees and visitors are prohibited from carrying weapons onto Company premises.
> 

### Procedures for Reporting a Threat

> All potentially dangerous situations, including threats by co-workers, must be reported immediately to any member of Management with whom you feel comfortable. Reports of threats may be maintained confidential to the extent maintaining confidentiality does not impede our ability to investigate and respond to the complaints. All threats will be promptly investigated, and employees must cooperate with investigations. No employee will be subjected to retaliation, intimidation or disciplinary action as a result of reporting a threat in good faith under this policy.
> 

## PROBLEM RESOLUTION

> Alliance attempts to provide positive working conditions for its employees, including encouraging an open and frank atmosphere in which problems, concerns, suggestions, or questions receive a timely and appropriate response from management. We attempt to foster an environment of fairness, respect, and integrity for all employees.
> 
> 
> If a situation occurs where you need to discuss an issue, problem, concern, etc., you are encouraged to contact your manager. If your manager is unavailable or if you believe it would not be best to contact that person, you may contact the next highest level of management. If, however, your concern relates to unlawful discrimination or harassment in the workplace that has not or cannot be adequately addressed by management at your location, contact someone in Human Resources to help you resolve the issue.
> 

## ATTENDANCE AND PUNCTUALITY

> Due to the nature of our work in support of our patients and clients, attendance and punctuality are matters of utmost importance. The ability of departments and work locations to operate effectively is significantly influenced by employee dependability. Alliance’s responsibility for continued and uninterrupted care of our patients can only be fulfilled when each of us assumes responsibility to be present and ready to work according to the work schedule.
> 
> 
> If you are unable to report to work at your scheduled time, you are expected to notify your manager as far in advance as possible. This should be a minimum of two hours before the start of your workday. Notice should be given by speaking directly to your manager or confirming that he/she has received the message. Sending an email or text message are acceptable forms of communication if agreed upon by your manager.
> 
> Calling into your manager to inform them of an absence or tardiness, though required, does not excuse the employee’s absence. Normal disciplinary policies will apply if poor attendance becomes excessive or where there is unexplained or unreported absenteeism. Any planned absences must be approved by the employee’s manager.
> 
> Some attendance situations may be considered a voluntary termination of employment. These include, but are not limited to: failure to return on the scheduled day at the end of an approved leave of absence; no call, no show on each of two consecutive scheduled work days; or job abandonment by leaving the work location without permission or notification to your manager.
> 
> If you are absent due to illness or injury, you may be requested to obtain fitness for duty documentation from your physician before returning to work.
> 

## PROFESSIONAL APPEARANCE

> Our patients and clients establish impressions of us based on our daily interaction with them. It is important that each of us is not only skilled, efficient, and courteous, but also contributes to the positive image of Alliance through appropriate dress and demeanor.
> 
> 
> The following guidelines apply for clinical staff: Our preference is that company logo shirts are worn in the clinic or worksite. Clothing should be in good condition and free of holes, tears, or stains. Footwear should be professional and appropriate for your work setting. Jeans and casual attire are permitted on Fridays or at the discretion of clinic management.
> 
> For Central Services staff, the following guidelines apply:
> 
> Attire in the office environment should be business casual. Jeans are permitted on Fridays or at the discretion of senior management. Clothing should be in good condition, free of holes and stains. Footwear should be appropriate for an office setting.
> 
> Our work involves close contact with patients and co-workers. Please use good judgment when personal hygiene is concerned. We need to be mindful that some may possess allergies and or extreme sensitivity to certain odors and therefore only very mild fragrances, perfumes, or scented lotions are to be worn. Gum chewing is not allowed during patient or visitor contact.
> 
> Please speak with your manager for professional appearance guidelines that are specific to your work location.
> 

## SOCIAL SECURITY PRIVACY POLICY

> Alliance takes each employee’s privacy very seriously, and it maintains a strict policy to protect the confidentiality of social security numbers and other personal information it obtains during the course of employment.
> 
> 
> The Company will maintain documents containing social security numbers and other private information in confidential files. Except as required by necessary and legitimate business purposes, no employee is permitted to have access to social security numbers, or to keep, view, use, copy, disclose, or distribute another person’s social security number or private information. Any employee who accesses social security numbers or private information for necessary and legitimate business purposes is prohibited from using or accessing the social security number in a manner that may permit an unauthorized individual to view, use, or access the number or private information.
> 
> When documents containing social security numbers or private information are no longer needed and are to be discarded, such documents must be disposed of in a manner that ensures the confidentiality of the social security numbers and private information. Alliance has developed a practice for shredding, electronically deleting, or otherwise disposing of confidential records, including documents containing social security numbers. Violation of this policy is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
> 

## COMPANY PROPERTY

> Computer equipment, desks, phones, storage areas, systems, and software are the property of Alliance. This equipment is made available to our employees solely for the purposes of conducting job-related activities. The unauthorized use of equipment including the installation or use of non-company provided software or programs is strictly forbidden.
> 
> 
> All information created or retained through the use of Alliance’s equipment, systems, or software is the property of the company. Alliance reserves the right to monitor the operations of our equipment and systems and inspect and have access to the information at our discretion with or without prior warning.

> Employees should not have any expectation of privacy in any electronic information, messages, voice mails, emails, or files sent, received, or stored in Company computers, email, voice mail, or software systems. At times, it may be necessary for Alliance to access any or all these devices and review and obtain information contained in them. In addition, Alliance may disclose the information on these devices to persons or entities other than the creator or recipient of the communication or information. While it is not Alliance’s desire to regularly access these devices, it is important for employees to understand that it may become necessary for us to do so.

## CELL PHONE USAGE

> Employees are expected to exercise discretion and good judgment when using personal cellular phones during work. Excessive personal calls and/or texting during the workday can interfere with employee productivity and be distracting to employees and their co-workers. Employees are asked to make personal calls and texts on non- work time whenever possible and ensure that family and friends are aware of this policy as well. It is strongly encouraged that employees put their personal phones away during normal operational hours to avoid distractions and maintain a professional environment.
> 
> 
> Employees who are provided a monetary allotment for his/her cell phone shall ensure that the phone is on when requested by their manager and that the number is provided as necessary.
> 
> Using camera phones or other audio or video recording devices within the company could constitute invasion of employees’ or patients’ personal privacy, as well as potentially a breach of confidentiality of Alliance’s protected information including the privacy of our patients. The use of cameras or other video recording devices within the company is strictly prohibited
> 
> without prior permission from senior management and the person present at the time.
> 
> Cell phone use while driving should be kept to a minimum. Whenever possible, employees should complete calls while the vehicle is parked or use the phone in a “hands free” mode. Employees are responsible for adhering to all applicable local, state and federal laws regarding cell phone usage. When driving, attention to the road should always take precedence over conducting business over the phone. In no circumstances should an employee ever text or attempt to retrieve emails while operating a vehicle.
> 
> There may be times when the company may issue a business-owned cell phone. In this case, the phone is meant for work-related communications and such phones should be used for business reasons only. If an employee has possession of a company phone and the phone becomes damaged, it is the responsibility of the employee to bear the cost of a replacement.
> 

## SOCIAL MEDIA

> Social media is a powerful force in our culture that offers many benefits for companies. But with the advantages of social media come challenges. While Alliance views social media positively, employees’ online activities can reflect negatively on the organization or have negative consequences for it. This is true whether you access social media at work or from your home, on or off the clock.
> 
> 
> Generally speaking, employees should follow Alliance’s policies regarding employee dignity, discrimination, and protecting confidential information when using social media. Perhaps
> 
> most importantly, use good judgement before posting potentially controversial information on social media sites. If you are unclear as to whether something is appropriate, it is best to refrain and get the advice from someone in management.
> 
> Business use of social media – that is, social media on behalf of Alliance – is prohibited absent authorization from the company. Only those officially designated by Alliance have the authorization to speak for the company. When communicating through social media, you must make it clear that you are not speaking on behalf of Alliance unless you have been expressly authorized to do so.
> 
> You should assume that your colleagues, our patients and others may read items you post online, even if you label the information as “private”. Never post any information about Alliance that you know to be false. Also, do not post anything that may make yourself or Alliance to appear unprofessional.
> 
> Alliance would like to remind you that there could be consequences to what you post online, so think twice before you post something on social media. Information posted online may be used by Alliance to investigate suspected misconduct or violations of company policy.
> 
> This policy is designed to protect Alliance’s legitimate business interests, while allowing you to engage in the use of social media as freely as possible. Nothing in this policy is designed or intended to (and won’t be enforced as to) interfere with protected employee communications about important workplace issues.
> 

## DRUG & ALCOHOL-FREE WORKPLACE

> Alliance is committed to maintaining a safe, healthy, and productive workplace for all employees.

> 
> The unlawful possession, sale, distribution or use of a prohibited substance in the workplace or while engaged in Alliance’s business off premises is strictly prohibited.

> 
> 
> Also, in compliance with the OSHA standard covering blood borne pathogens, Alliance offers the three-injection Hepatitis B vaccination series free to all employees who may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials as part of their job duties. Those employees who opt out of the vaccination series will be required to sign a Hepatitis B vaccination declination statement. Other health requirements such as a TB skin test may be required, depending on the facility. Refusal to complete required health screenings may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.
> 

## TRAVEL AND EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT

> 
> 
> All Expense Reimbursement Reports must include the following:
> 
- Original receipts for all expenses incurred, including itemized meal receipts, car rentals and taxi service (Uber/Lyft).

- business related conference registration fees

> Any personal, non-work-related expenses will not be reimbursed.
> 

## OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT

> Alliance asks its employees to dedicate the time, talent, and energy necessary to do their jobs well and meet the needs of our clients. Employees may engage in outside employment only if the outside employment does not create actual or potential conflicts of interest, is compliant with all applicable laws, regulations and rules, and only to the extent that doing so does not interfere with the employee’s productivity and effectiveness in their position.
> 

## REFERRAL BONUS

> At Alliance, we encourage you to help further the positive culture we have by referring other hard-working and competent individuals to apply to work for us.
> 
> 
> For certain positions, you may be eligible to receive a referral bonus for referring a candidate who is hired. Persons referred by Alliance employees must be generated independent of their job duties (e.g. not through a student observation, resume submissions, attending career fairs, etc.). To be eligible for a bonus, the candidate referred must be hired and work a minimum of ninety (90) days as an Alliance employee. For more information regarding the referral bonus program, talk to a Talent Acquisition Specialist.
> 

## GRATUITIES AND GIFTS

> Alliance believes in providing an ethical work environment, where each employee conducts themselves with integrity and complies with all applicable laws. To that end, employees shall not seek or accept for themselves or others any gifts, loans, entertainment, payments, or favors from any persons or business organizations that do or seek to do business with or is a competitor of Alliance.
> 
> 
> Employees should avoid any business relationship, transaction, or benefit that may create or have an appearance of a conflict of interest between their interests and the interests of Alliance and its patients. If there is a potential situation that may involve a conflict of interest, employees shall make prompt and full disclosures to their manager. Any violation of this policy will subject the employee to
> 
> disciplinary action up to and including termination.
> 

## CLOSE OF BUSINESS

> In the case where Alliance determines that a clinic or office should be closed early due for any reason, including a holiday, hourly employees will only be paid for the hours worked that day. Hourly employees may supplement PTO for those hours.
> 
> 
> In the case of inclement weather, clinics may not close for business without obtaining approval from the Group Director, VP of Operations, or COO. If this occurs during the middle of a work day, non-exempt (hourly) employees will be paid for a minimum of two hours, or actual hours worked, whichever is greater, and exempt (salaried) employees will be paid for a regularly scheduled day. It is likely that the closing of the clinic will create an increase in the schedule for the remainder of the week to provide an opportunity to see patients that were missed. Employees will be expected to flex their hours as needed to accommodate such changes.
> 
> In the event that a location is determined to be shutdown prior to the beginning of the work day due to inclement weather, power failure, safety reasons, or other similar reasons, the clinic director or department manager will make every effort to contact employees who are scheduled to work that day and instruct them to stay home. Employees may choose to use PTO or take time without pay for the day. If the location is later opened and work becomes available, the clinic director will request, but not require employees to come to work.
> 

## SOLICITATION AND DISTRIBUTION POLICY

> Employees may not solicit other employees during the working time of either employee, on behalf of any individual, organization, association, club, or cause.
> 
> 
> Employees may not distribute any literature, pamphlet, or other material to an employee during the working time of either employee, or at any time in any working area.
> 
> “Working time” does not include break periods, meal periods, or any other specified periods during the workday when employees are not engaged in performing their work tasks.
> 
> Persons who are not employed by the Company may not solicit employees during working time or distribute literature for any purpose in any working area or any area restricted to employees only, unless authorized by the CEO, CFO, or COO. Unauthorized entry, solicitation, or distribution of materials on Company property, including our parking or pedestrian areas that are on private property, is strictly prohibited.
> 

## IMMIGRATION LAW COMPLIANCE

> Alliance is committed to complying with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and other immigration laws. Each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9) and present documentation establishing the employee’s identity and employment eligibility as required under law. Former employees who are rehired must also complete this form if they have not completed an I-9 within the past three years or if their previous I-9 is no longer retained or valid.
> 

## SAFETY

> We take safety seriously. It is very important to Alliance that all employees maintain and promote a safe working environment. All tasks should be conducted in a safe and efficient manner, complying with all federal, state, and local safety and health regulations. It is the responsibility of each employee to identify and familiarize him or herself with the emergency plan for his/her working area. If you notice an unsafe practice or work area, please notify your manager immediately.
> 

## WORK-RELATED ACCIDENTS AND INCIDENTS

> In the event you are injured while engaged in the performance of Alliance duties, you should immediately report the incident to your manager. If medical attention is needed, promptly follow the medical treatment protocol for your work location.
> 
> 
> In conjunction with your manager, complete an Employee Incident Report and fax or email it to the Human Resources Department, even if no medical treatment is necessary.
> 
> Alliance may designate a physician or medical facility who will render the necessary medical treatment for a work-related incident. If you are incapacitated due to a work-related incident, Human Resources will be in contact with you regarding following up on medical treatment with the designated physician and the coordination of your return to work date.
> 
> If you are eligible to return to work with restrictions, you may be placed in a temporary restricted duty position that complies with the physician’s directive. Before reporting back to work, you must contact Human Resources.
> 

## WORKERS COMPENSATION

> Workers’ compensation insurance is provided to cover accidental injuries you may sustain while at work. If your claim is accepted, this insurance will cover medical expenses and earnings lost due to injury while you are on the job. The individual laws of the state where you are working will regulate the amount you may be entitled to receive.
> 
> 
> A safe environment is everyone’s responsibility. If you are aware of any safety issues, it is your responsibility to report your concerns to your manager. If you are injured during the course of working, you must notify your manager immediately. Failure to report the incident may jeopardize your benefits and your employment.
> 

# LEAVES OF ABSENCE

> Leaves of absence are granted to protect the employee’s length of service and any accrued benefits, as well as to allow the employee to return to Alliance employment. An employee who accepts other unauthorized employment during a leave of absence, or who engages in activities that are inconsistent with the purpose of the leave of absence, will be considered to have terminated his or her employment with Alliance without notice as of the date the leave began.
> 

## FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE

> An employee who has been employed with Alliance for at least one (1) year and has worked at least twelve hundred fifty (1,250) hours in the past twelve (12) months may be eligible under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for time off from work for the following reasons:
> 
- Birth of a child and to care for that child;
- Placement of a child for adoption or foster care;

> If both spouses work for Alliance Physical Therapy Partners and are eligible for Family/Medical Leave, the maximum combined leave for the birth of a child or for adoption or foster care placement is twelve (12) weeks.
> 
> 
> *Any leave taken for the birth or care of a child or the placement of a child for adoption or foster care must be completed within one year after the date of birth or placement.*
> 
- Care for a seriously ill spouse, child, or parent;
- The employee’s own serious health condition that prevents him or her from performing the functions of his or her job.

> Serious Health Condition – A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care provider for a condition that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the employee’s job, or prevents the qualified family member from participating in school or other daily activities.
> 
> 
> Ordinarily, the common cold, the flu, earaches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other than migraines, routine dental or orthodontic problems, etc. are examples of conditions that do not meet the definition of a serious health condition and do not qualify for Family Medical Leave.
> 
> With regard to substance abuse (including alcohol abuse), Family Medical Leave may be taken only for treatment of substance abuse by or on referral from a healthcare provider.
> 
> Absences caused by the employee’s use of substance, rather than treatment, do not qualify for Family Medical Leave.
> 
> An employee is expected to consult with his or her manager before planning a leave for medical treatment in order to schedule the treatment at a time that least affects Alliance and its operations. Note that this procedure applies to all requests for time off, whether or not the request is covered by the FMLA.
> 
> **Certification** – The FMLA requires employees to respond to reasonable requests for information regarding their leave, and failure to do so may result in delay or denial of the requested leave. In addition, the employee may be required to provide the certification described below. It is their obligation to provide a complete and sufficient certification form to the company within 15 calendar days after the company requests it. If it is not practicable for the employee to provide a completed, sufficient certification form within 15 days despite their diligent, good faith efforts to do so, the employee must contact Human Resources to explain the situation.
> 
> If the employee returns a certification form, but it is incomplete (i.e. one or more items are left blank) or insufficient (i.e., responses are vague, illegible, ambiguous, or non-responsive) the company will notify the employee of the deficiency. The employee will then have seven
> 
> (7) calendar days to provide a complete, sufficient certification.
> 
> The company may contact the health care provider to authenticate a completed certification form by providing the health care provider a copy of the form and requesting verification that the information contained on the form was written or authorized by the health care provider who signed the document.
> 
> The company may request clarification of information on the certification form, and may ask the employee to sign, or have their family member sign, a release form authorizing the heath care provider to communicate with the company for the purpose of clarifying the certification. If the certification is unclear and the employee fails to provide a signed authorization or otherwise clarify the certification, the company may deny the request for Family Medical Leave.
> 
> **Designation of Leave** – The company will provide an employee with written notice advising whether their leave will be designated as Family Medical Leave. Absent extenuating circumstances, the company will provide this notice within five (5) business days after it received sufficient information to determine whether the requested leave is for a FML reason. If the company does not provide the designation notice within the time specified above, the Company may retroactively notify an employee that time off will be designated as FML if the delay in providing the notice does not cause the employee harm or injury, or if they and the company agree that the time off will be designated as Family Medical Leave.
> 
> **Length of Leave** - A Family Medical Leave may not exceed twelve (12) weeks in a twelve (12) month period. The company will use a “rolling” 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any Family Medical Leave. Available leave is determined by subtracting the number of weeks of Family Medical leave taken during this 12-month “look back” period from the 12-week total allowed.
> 
> If medically necessary, an employee may take leave on an intermittent basis or in the form of a reduced workweek. If an employee requires foreseeable intermittent or reduced schedule leave, the employee will be expected to consult
> 
> their manager as well as Human Resources to work out a schedule that meets the employee’s needs without unduly disrupting the company’s operations, subject to the approval of the health care provider. An employee may be transferred to a different position for intermittent or reduced workweek leave.
> 
> A leave under the Family Medical Leave Act due to the employee’s own illness that exceeds twelve (12) weeks may be continued under the provisions of the Alliance Non-Family Medical Leave of Absence policy.
> 
> **Reporting Requirements During Leave**- During the leave, an employee may be required to provide periodic reports on his or her status and intent to return to work on the scheduled date. The employee must notify the company of any change in their expected return to work date (i.e., if they will require more leave than originally anticipated, or if they will return to work earlier than expected) as soon as practicable under the circumstances. Failure to provide the information may affect the leave and/or the employee’s employment status.
> 
> If the employee’s intention is to not return from leave, it will be considered a voluntary resignation, effective the date it is communicated to Alliance.
> 
> **Job Availability** - An employee will be returned to the position held prior to the leave or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment if he or she returns to work within twelve (12) weeks. If the leave was for the employee’s own illness, the employee will be required to provide medical evidence of ability to resume previous duties prior to return to work. However, the employee may not be reinstated in certain circumstances, such as if their employment would have been terminated for reasons unrelated to their Family Medical
> 
> Leave, or if they are unable to perform the essential functions of their job (with or without any required accommodations).
> 
> In any event, the longest an employee can be off work through a non-medical leave of absence is twelve (12) months. Once an employee is unable to return to work after twelve consecutive months, he/she will be terminated from employment.
> 
> **Use of Accrued Paid Time Off** - The employee must use accrued paid time off time to cover any unpaid time during any Leave of Absence.
> 
> **Benefits During the Leave** – For up to six (6) months, an employee on leave of absence will continue to receive medical benefits on the same basis as if he or she were actively working. If Alliance’s benefits change during a leave, the employee will be notified of the change and will be affected as if actively working. Family Medical Leave time is considered as continued service for purposes of length of service.
> 
> In order to receive medical benefits on leave, the employee must pay their normal contribution on a timely basis. Alliance reserves the right to terminate benefits while an employee is on leave of absence for non-payment of employee contributions.
> 
> **Prohibitions** - The following conduct is strictly prohibited in relation to Family Medical Leave:
> 
- Engaging in fraud, misrepresentation or providing false information to the company or any health care provider
- Having other employment during the leave, without prior written approval from the company
- Failure to comply with the employee’s

> obligations under this policy
> 
- Failure to timely return from the leave

> Employees who engage in such conduct will be subject to the loss of benefits, denial or termination of leave, and discipline, up to and including termination of employment.
> 
> 
> **How to Request Leave** - An employee should contact a Human Resource representative as soon as feasible to request a leave of absence of any type. In all cases, it is the employee’s responsibility to notify Human Resources of the reason for their time off, as well as the expected timing and duration of the time off.
> 
> When scheduling time off, you will be expected to consult with your supervisor and Human Resources to work out a schedule for leave that, to the extent possible, meets your needs without unduly disrupting the company’s operations. Failure to comply with this policy or to provide documentation or information requested by Human Resources may result in delay or denial of requested time off, and/or discipline up to and including termination of employment.
> 
> **The Company’s Commitment** – The company recognizes the co-existence of state and/or local laws regarding family and medical leave. Where such laws apply and provide greater family and medical leave rights than the FMLA, the company will comply with those laws.
> 

## NON-FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE

### Personal Leave

> Alliance recognizes that, although rare, there may be times when an employee finds it necessary to be absent from work for a predetermined period of time due to personal, medical, or educational reasons. Alliance will consider an employee’s request for a Personal Leave of Absence on a case-by-case basis. The
> 
> 
> employee must use accrued PTO during the leave. An employee on a leave of absence will continue to receive health benefits while on leave, providing they pay the normal employee contribution portion. Employees should contact their manager or a Human Resources representative as soon as feasible to request any type of leave of absence.
> 
> If the employee’s intention is to not return from leave, it will be considered a voluntary resignation, effective the date it is communicated to Alliance.
> 

### Military Leave

> Alliance is proud of those who commit to service of our country in the military or other uniformed services. An important obligation as an employer is to make sure that those colleagues who are engaged in qualifying activities are able to leave their employment with the knowledge that their employment rights are protected. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) provides many important rights and benefits for employees who perform military duty. It is Alliance’s policy to comply with all requirements of USERRA and other state and federal laws related to military service. If you should require leave for uniformed service, please contact your manager as early as possible. The manager will coordinate with Human Resources to ensure the applicable provisions of USERRA are handled appropriately.
> 

### Disability Leave

> A disability leave may be granted when a health care provider certifies that an employee is unable to work due to illness, injury, or other qualified condition, including pregnancy and childbirth. To apply for such a leave, the employee and healthcare provider must submit
> 
> 
> proper documentation. These leaves nearly always will coincide with FMLA. There are times when Alliance may require further certification of the employee’s inability to work from a healthcare provider and could require the employee to be examined by another health care provider selected by Alliance. An employee who is on disability leave will not be permitted to return to work until they have submitted the appropriate return to work documentation from the employee’s health care provider.
> 
> Typically, the maximum duration of any type of leave of absence is twelve (12) months.
> 

# COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

### Compensation Philosophy

> At Alliance we strive to keep our compensation and benefit program competitive within our industry, and at the same time, have it fit within the financial realities of our operations.
> 
> 
> Typically, wages may be adjusted upward based on several factors: employees exceeding performance standards; clinic or site performance; trends in local market rates; and the company’s overall financial ability to afford increases. Increases will not necessarily be tied to the timing of performance reviews. Our philosophy is to run our business by remaining competitive with wages and benefits in the job market so we can continue to attract and retain the best talent. In any event, Alliance maintains the full and complete discretion to adjust compensation as it sees fit.
> 

## EMPLOYMENT CATEGORIES

> Alliance employees fall into one of the following employment classifications. None of these classifications guarantee employment for any specified period of time or otherwise alters the at-will nature of your employment.
> 

### Exempt/Non-exempt:

> All employees are classified as either exempt or non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state law. Employees who are classified as exempt do not receive compensation for overtime hours. Employees who are classified as non-exempt do receive compensation for overtime hours. Employees who have any questions regarding their classification should contact Human Resources.
> 

### Regular, Full-Time Employees:

> Regular, full-time employees are those who are not working on a temporary status, and who are regularly scheduled to work thirty-six (36) or more hours per week. Generally, they are eligible for employee benefit programs, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program.
> 

### Regular, Part-Time Employees:

> Regular, part-time employees are those who are regularly scheduled to work between twenty
> 
> 
> (20) and thirty-five (35) hours per week. Generally, they are eligible for employee benefit programs, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program. Some of the benefits will be pro-rated, based on this status.
> 

### PRN/Limited Part-Time Employees:

> Employees who either regularly work less than 20 hours per week, or work on an irregular, intermittent basis, and who are designated as PRN/limited part-time employees. These employees are not eligible for employee benefit programs such as health benefits, PTO, or holiday pay.
> 

### Temporary Employees:

> Employees who are hired for a specific short- term period of time to perform a specific job or project. These employees are not eligible for employee benefit programs such as health benefits, PTO, or holiday pay.
> 
> 
> There may be fluctuations in work schedules that cause employees to fall into another category for a short period of time. Alliance reserves the right to change an employee’s status, however, typically these changes occur when the hours worked are consistent over two months or more (e.g. an employee who is part-time and works 38 hours for only two weeks will not be moved to a full-time status).
> 

## PAY PERIOD, PAY DEDUCTIONS, AND DIRECT DEPOSIT

> At Alliance, we use a biweekly pay period. Depending on your work location, employees will either be paid one or two weeks in arrears. For further clarification, employees should refer to a copy of their pay schedule.
> 

### Deductions

> Required or authorized payroll deductions are made each check. These include, but are not limited to the following:
> 
- Federal Income Tax Withholding
- State & Local Income Tax Withholding
- FICA – Social Security & Medicare Tax
- Health, dental, and life insurance premiums
- 401(k) deferrals
- Flexible Spending Account deferrals

> Alliance strongly encourages employees to review their paycheck deductions on a regular basis. Alliance will make every effort to avoid errors in your paycheck, however, if you believe
> 
> 
> that there has been an error, contact your manager immediately. If an error is in your favor it will be your responsibility to reimburse Alliance.
> 
> After the end of each calendar year, you will receive your W-2 which summarizes your income and deductions for the year. Paycheck stubs and W-2’s are available on Alliance’s self- service portal.
> 

### Direct Deposit

> As a benefit, Alliance offers direct deposit to electronically and automatically deposit employees’ paychecks in the bank of their choice. We strongly encourage the use of direct deposit as an efficient tool – for both Alliance and the employee. This benefit will be offered at hire, and at any time through the employee self- service portal.
> 

### Mileage Reimbursement

> Alliance reimburses employees when they use their personal vehicle for business purposes. Business miles are defined as miles driven to and from business locations, as required by the company. Normal commuting miles to and from work cannot be submitted for reimbursement. Mileage is a nontaxable business expense and is included with your regular paycheck.
> 
> 
> Travel to and from work locations within the day can be submitted for mileage reimbursement. When working at an alternate work site for the entire day, the employee must subtract his/her normal commute miles before claiming any mileage reimbursement.
> 

### Travel Time

> The following guidelines pertain to non-exempt employee travel time:
> 
- An employee's travel time (time spent walking, riding or traveling) to and from his or her work location and traveling to or from a local training program is not compensable.
- When traveling, meal periods and/or break periods of 30 minutes or more are not compensable.
- If an employee is required to drive from site to site during the workday, this travel time is compensable work time. If after spending the workday at different locations, the Employee is then required to return to the office/clinic, this travel time is also compensable work time.
- In the event an employee is required to travel as part of a special trip involving a one- day assignment and this commute is longer than his or her normal daily commute to work, this additional travel time is compensable.
- If an employee must take an overnight trip out of town, all travel that occurs during the employee’s normal work hours (including Saturday and Sunday) will be compensated. If, however, the travel occurs outside of the employee's normal work hours, the travel time will not be compensated.
- When traveling, if the employee is offered public transportation (e.g. airline travel) and the employee elects to drive his or her personal automobile instead, the only time that is compensable is the time the employee would have spent traveling during his or her normal working hours (regardless of the day of the week) had the employee taken the public transportation.

## TIMEKEEPING AND OVERTIME

> To ensure all employees are paid properly, their time must be accounted for in the applicable timekeeping system. Non-exempt staff are responsible for clocking in at the beginning of work, out and back in for lunch periods, and out at the end of the workday. Failing to accurately record time worked can result in disciplinary action. When an employee clocks in for work, it is expected that he/she is ready to perform the assigned duties and begin working. Other than lunch, additional breaks shall be provided as required by state law. Off the clock work, or instructing another employee to work off the clock, is strictly prohibited.
> 
> 
> The payroll work week is defined as 12:00am Sunday through 11:59pm Saturday. An employee’s work hours will be established by his/her manager. Although we try to assign regular and consistent work hours, from time to time it may be necessary to modify hours to meet the needs of our patients and the demands of our operations.
> 
> All overtime and time over an employee’s normal schedule must be approved by an employee’s manager. There are times when employees are required to work overtime. Pay for overtime for non-exempt employees is calculated at one and one-half times the hourly rate for hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a payroll week, unless state law provides otherwise. Only actual work hours (vs. holiday, bereavement, etc.) count toward computing weekly overtime.
> 
> Exempt employees do not receive additional remuneration for working overtime. Instead, they are paid a regular weekly salary as full compensation for all hours worked during the work week.
> 

## PAID TIME OFF (PTO)

> At Alliance, vacation, sick, and personal time is considered one bank of time. At no time is there a bank of hours front loaded into an
> 
> 
> employee’s PTO account. Instead, you begin earning PTO each pay period as of your date of hire or a change to an eligible status (full or part-time) and the PTO is accrued over time.
> 
> An example of an accrual calculation per period is as follows. If an employee is earning 96 hours of PTO and is full-time, the biweekly accrual is 96 hours / 26 pay periods = 3.69 hours per paycheck.
> 
> The employee will continue to earn an additional 24 or 15 hours every three years at their anniversary date with the company at an eligible status, up to the company maximum of 184 hours for full time employees and 70 hours for part time employees.
> 
> In the example above, when the employee hits their next recognized anniversary date three years later, they will earn at the rate of 120 hours per year, which would be 4.62 hours per paycheck (120 hours / 26 pay periods).
> 
> The increased benefit is available after completion of indicated years with the company.
> 

| 3 - 5 | (approx. 3 days) | (approx. 3 days), up to 70 hours max |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 3
6 - 8 | Earn additional 24 hours
(approx. 3 days) | Earn additional 15 hours
(approx. 3 days), up to 70 hours max |
| Tier 4
9+ | Earn additional 24 hours
(approx. 3 days), up to 184 hours max |  |

> If the employee has not reached the allowable maximum of either 184 hours or 70 hours by their designated years of service, they will earn an additional 8 or 5 hours per year until it is achieved.
> 
> 
> Hourly (non-exempt) employees can use PTO in a minimum of 15-minute increments. Salaried (exempt) employees can only take PTO in either full or ½ day increments based on the standard workday schedule. With ½ day PTO usage, worked hours should be equal to or less than 4 or 5 hours, based on their standard scheduled hours. Employees must use enough PTO to achieve their **regularly scheduled** total weekly hours.
> 
> For example, if a part time employee is regularly scheduled to work 30 hours per week, and takes time off, they must use enough PTO to achieve a total of 30 hours for that week.
> 
> Employees can draw upon PTO hours up to their regularly scheduled number of hours per week. For full-time hourly staff, they can supplement PTO hours up to 40 per week and no more. For part-time, they can supplement up to their regularly scheduled hours per week; 25 hours
> 
> will be used as an average in the event of an irregular schedule.
> 
> The maximum PTO balance that an employee can carry is one times their annual earning rate. For instance, in the previous example at 120 hours per year, the most that employee can earn in their PTO bank is 120 hours. Once the maximum is reached, the employee’s accrual is frozen until PTO time is utilized to reduce the balance under the maximum.
> 
> Employees can only use PTO that is available in their balance. You cannot have a negative balance. **Accrued PTO must be taken before taking any unpaid time.**
> 
> When an employee leaves Alliance for any reason or drops to an ineligible status (such as PRN/limited part time), PTO will be paid out, **up to a maximum of 80 (eighty) hours, regardless of the employee’s balance.** All employees are expected to provide a reasonable notice period of four weeks, fully cooperate during the transition, and return any company property within a timely manner. **Alliance will comply with all applicable state laws.**
> 
> In all cases, employees must obtain approval from their manager before taking available PTO. The approval from their manager must be in accordance with the location’s guidelines.
> 
> Employees are generally expected to submit time off requests through the timekeeping system at least 45 days prior to the time off requested.
> 

## PAID HOLIDAYS

> Full and part-time employees are eligible for holiday pay as of their hire date or change to an eligible status (full or part-time). Alliance recognizes six holidays per year:
> 
- New Year’s Day
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Thanksgiving Day
- Christmas Day

> Full-time employees are eligible for up to eight
> 
> 
> (8) hours per holiday. Part-time employees are eligible for up to five (5) hours per holiday. **The company holiday must fall on your regularly scheduled workday for you to receive holiday pay.** Employees are not eligible for holiday pay while on a leave of absence.
> 
> In order to be paid for any holiday, you must work both your scheduled day before and after the holiday. If you are out on one or more of those days, you may be required to provide medical certification to receive the holiday pay. If you work in an Outpatient setting and elect to work on a company designated holiday, you will be eligible for both holiday pay and your regular wage.
> 
> Fox example: if the holiday falls on a Saturday, and you work on the company designated holiday (that preceding Friday), you will receive holiday pay (at either 8 or 5 hours, depending on status) and your regular wage that day.
> 
> If you work on the actual holiday, you will be eligible for either a coverage rate if you are salaried or 1.5x your hourly wage if you are hourly.
> 
> If you are not able to observe a company recognized holiday, you may be allowed a floating day to be used within that same month. The float day may not be carried over into the next month, nor may it be cashed out in the event of termination of employment.
> 

## BEREAVEMENT PAY

> Alliance recognizes that support and time off is often needed when close relatives pass away. For this reason, full and part-time employees are eligible for bereavement pay. Full-time employees will receive 8 hours and part-time will receive 5 hours for bereavement days.
> 
> 
> Up to three (3) days will be granted to make arrangements and attend the funeral service for a member of your immediate family that includes:
> 
- spouse
- child or stepchild
- parent

> Up to two (2) days will be granted to attend funeral services for a member of your extended family that includes:
> 
- sibling or stepsibling
- grandparent
- grandchild
- parent-in-law
- son/daughter-in-law
- stepparent

> You must complete a Bereavement Request Form and supply any requested documentation to qualify for bereavement pay.
> 
> 
> If a bereavement day falls during an employee’s approved paid time off, the employee will be entitled to the paid bereavement day instead of paid time off. An employee will not receive bereavement pay after submitting a notice of resignation.
> 

## JURY DUTY

> Alliance fully supports the right and responsibility of employees to perform their civic duty by serving on a jury. If you are called for jury duty, you must provide to your manager a copy of the jury summons notification as soon as practicable in advance of the jury duty dates. To the extent possible, we ask that you keep your manager informed of the process, anticipated schedule and need for time off. The employee who fulfills the responsibility of jury duty will be paid for regular hours missed. Any compensation received from the court will need to be paid to Alliance. This does not include travel, mileage, or meal reimbursement. Additional clarification can be provided by a member of the Payroll department.
> 

## BENEFIT ELIGIBILITY

> You and your dependents become eligible for Alliance’s benefit plans on the first day of the month following thirty (30) days of employment. You must be at a full or part-time employment status to be eligible for these benefits. After your initial elections, you will have an opportunity to change those elections each year during the open enrollment period. If you do not make any changes during open enrollment, you will automatically be re-enrolled in your current elections. The exception to this is the Flexible Spending Account where you have to re-establish how much of your own funds you want to contribute to these plans each year. The elections you make during open enrollment will remain in effect until you make a subsequent change due to a qualifying event, open enrollment, or you lose eligibility to participate in the Alliance insurance plans.
> 
> 
> The IRS has established rules for your elections, which dictate that once you have made your elections for the plan year, you may not change

## COBRA

> The right to COBRA continuation coverage was created by federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). COBRA continuation coverage may become available to you when you lose your group health coverage. It can also become available to other members of your family who are covered under the Alliance health insurance plans when they lose their group health coverage. These are also known as qualifying events, as described above in the benefits eligibility section. After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a qualified beneficiary. You, your spouse, and your dependent children may become qualified beneficiaries if coverage is lost because of the qualifying event. You will become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your
