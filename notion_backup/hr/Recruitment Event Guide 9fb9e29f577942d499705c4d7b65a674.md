# Recruitment Event Guide

Recruitment events are a great way to connect with local students and target programs with upcoming graduation dates, as well as increase brand recognition in the area. These events should be give and take—you’ll want to make ensure you’re offering something in return for student attendance, whether it’s free food and drink at an Open House, or professional development opportunities at a more targeted event (e.g. Resume Workshop, Mock Interviews, etc.). 

## Here is a guide for planning and executing a successful recruitment event:

1. **Determine Event Details** *(suggested: start planning at least four weeks in advance)*
    1. Confirm the date, time, and location of your event and confirm your target audience
    2. Ensure that there are no conflicting events for the targeted students (clinical rotation dates, exams, etc.)

2. **Registration & Marketing** 
    1. University Relations Specialist will create an Eventbrite page to track registrations and share with appropriate university and student contacts 
    2. Marketing will assist with additional promotional materials as needed. Things to consider when determining marketing needs: 
        1. *Social*: What platforms do you want to promote on? Different platforms may use different formatting techniques to stand out (*note: QR codes should not be used in social media posts*)
        2. *Print*: Do you need physical flyers printed for distribution? 
        3. *Digital*: Does event information need to be added to the website?  
        4. *Promotional items*: requests for promotional items can be submitted to Marketing [here](https://intranet.allianceptp.com/bd941b39-cf66-4714-9d15-a6e3acfbdec8).

3. ****************************Event Planning****************************
    1. If the event is taking place outside of the clinic, ensure space is reserved 
    2. Determine who will be attending (local leadership, clinicians, etc.) 
        1. *Suggested: when targeting a specific program, ask alumni PTs to attend the event and share the information within their network* 
    3. Print desired marketing materials ahead of time
    4. Having a digital or physical sign-in sheet prepared and nametags available 
        1. *Information to collect on sign-in: Name, email, school, and graduation date*
4. **After the Event**
    1. Share attendee information with Group Director and University Relations Specialist 
    2. University Relations Specialist will send a thank you email with additional Alliance/Group information 
    3. ***Group/Clinic Directors should follow up personally with potential candidates***
